      "strDescriptionEN": "A Rush of Blood to the Head is the second studio album by British alternative rock band Coldplay. Released on 26 August 2002 in the UK through the label Parlophone, the album was produced by the band and British record producer Ken Nelson. Recording started after the band became popular worldwide with the release of their debut album, Parachutes, and one of its singles in particular, \"Yellow\". Attitudes to songwriting were affected by the September 11 attacks in the United States, which occurred the week before recording started. The songs featured in the album have a greater use of piano and electric guitar than its predecessor.\n\nThe album was made available in August 2002, two months after its original planned release date. It was released on 27 August in the United States through Capitol Records. Capitol released a remastered version of the album in 2008 on a 180-gram vinyl record as part of the \"From the Capitol Vaults\" series. The album debuted and continued their huge commercial legacy, an ongoing pattern that began with Parachutes which made Coldplay one of the best-selling bands worldwide. It topped the UK Album Charts upon its first week of release in the United Kingdom, and became the eighth biggest-selling albums in the 21st century in the UK. The British Phonographic Industry has since certified the album 9x platinum for its accumulated sales of over 2.7 million units in Britain and over 15 million worldwide. The album spawned the hit singles \"In My Place\", \"The Scientist\", \"Clocks\", and \"God Put a Smile upon Your Face\".\n\nA Rush of Blood to the Head has been critically acclaimed, and it won the band the 2003 Grammy for Best Alternative Album for the second time in a row, successive to their previous win in the same category, and the 2004 Grammy for Record of the Year for the song \"Clocks\". In 2003 it was ranked number 473 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.",

Es wurde zwischen September 2001 und Mai 2002 in London und Liverpool aufgenommen und am 26. August 2002 ver\u00f6ffentlicht. Die Band begann nur eine Woche nach den Terroranschl\u00e4gen vom 11. September 2001 mit den Aufnahmen f\u00fcr ihr zweites Studioalbum. Die vergangenen Ereignisse wurden teilweise auch als Inspiration f\u00fcr die Songtexte angegeben und beeinflussten den Songwritingprozess. Die Gruppe schrieb insgesamt \u00fcber 20 Lieder f\u00fcr das Album, das Erste davon war In My Place, welches die Band auch als erste Single aus dem Album herausbrachte. Laut S\u00e4nger Chris Martin war dies auch das entscheidende Lied, welches die anderen Lieder \u201eeinfach so entstehen\u201c lie\u00dfen.\nMusikalisch hat die Band ihr Klangfeld ausgebaut, unter anderem treten h\u00e4ufiger Piano- und E-Gitarrenkl\u00e4nge in Erscheinung als auf dem Vorg\u00e4ngeralbum.",

De A Rush of Blood to the Head se extrajeron los sencillos \"In My Place\", \"The Scientist\", \"Clocks\" y \"God Put a Smile Upon Your Face\".

Decidieron finalmente reubicarse en Liverpool, donde hab\u00edan grabado algunas canciones para Parachutes. Una vez all\u00ed, el vocalista Chris Martin dijo que se obsesionaron con la grabaci\u00f3n.\n\"In My Place\" fue la primera canci\u00f3n que se grab\u00f3 para el \u00e1lbum.

      "strReview": "Perhaps unsurprisingly, Coldplay's new album A Rush Of Blood To The Head is a consolidated evolution from their comparatively na\u00c3\u00afve debut, Parachutes. The die-hard Coldplay fans looking for another Parachutes and the bloodthirsty critics who demand to see some progression will all walk away happy.\nA Rush of Blood to the Head is inimitably Coldplay; Chris Martin's familiar vocals, the band's signature harmonies, strings and piano are all there but disarmingly there is a lot more to this album. It's undoubtedly the album we all expected but it's also smarter; more poetic, more mature.\n\"Politik\", the album's opener makes for a driving, imposing start with Martin's distinctive vocals reverberating eerily above urgent piano chords. It's unusually dramatic for a band once dubbed by ex-Creation mogul Alan McGee as \"Bedwetters\". The second track, the first written post-Parachutes and sounding like a refugee from that album, is the grower \"In My Place\". It's a fantastic pop tune that justifies Coldplay's status as one of UK's most exciting bands.\nThe haunting, surprisingly cynical theme that originates in \"Politik\" is continued in \"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\" which sees the band at full stretch, lyrically as well as musically. You can sense them pushing themselves to prove to the world that there is a lot more to Coldplay than chart friendly singles.\nThen, mid-album, they let all their hard work go to waste with the insipid, vanilla tracks \"The Scientist\" and \"Clocks\". They pass you by and fail to raise even the smallest emotion. Daylight\" and \"A Whisper\" find the band back at their best with epic, yet simple melancholic tunes. Here repetitive choruses and hypnotic, violin sounding guitars take the listener on an exciting journey that you wish wouldn't end.\nColdplay are a band very much in touch with their emotions, which frequently works in their favour. Martin's heartfelt, passionate vocals on the piano driven \"Warning Sign\" transform a song which in other hands could descend to the pathetic: \"Come on in, I've got to tell you what a state I'm in...The truth is I miss you\"\nDespite a couple of weak moments this is asuperb album that might just capture your heart and your imagination. Don't struggle; enjoy a rush of blood to the head.",

      "strDescriptionFR": "Parachutes est le premier album du groupe anglais Coldplay. Il est sorti en septembre 2000 en France, et le 7 juin 2000 au Royaume-Uni.\n\nProduit par le groupe et Ken Nelson (\u00e0 l'exception de High Speed, produite par Chris Allison), il fut globalement tr\u00e8s bien re\u00e7u par le public et les critiques, certifi\u00e9 \"platine\" 7 fois au Royaume-Uni (o\u00f9 il se poste \u00e0 la douzi\u00e8me place des 20 plus grosses ventes du XXIe si\u00e8cle, avec plus 2,4 millions d'exemplaires \u00e9coul\u00e9s \u00e0 ce jour), et 2 fois aux \u00c9tats-Unis depuis sa sortie. Il fut prim\u00e9 du \"Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album\" en 2002 et du \"Best British Album\" au Brit Awards de 2001.\n\nLe groupe s'attela \u00e0 l'album en 1999, sous les auspices de Chris Allison, et il en ressortit leur troisi\u00e8me EP, \"The Blue Room\". Cependant, le courant sembla plut\u00f4t mal passer entre la bande et le producteur, qui les emp\u00eachait d'avoir un contr\u00f4le global sur le processus de cr\u00e9ation. Il fut donc remplac\u00e9 par Nelson, qui, apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9coute de leur premier EP, avait senti \u00ab quelque chose de sp\u00e9cial \u00bb dans la voix de Chris Martin sur le morceau Bigger Stronger. Nelson, qui pr\u00e9f\u00e9ra assister le groupe dans l'\u00e9laboration de leurs id\u00e9es plut\u00f4t que d'y interf\u00e9rer, affirma que ce premier travail n'\u00e9tait pas sa production, mais bien une co-production entre lui et Coldplay.\n\nLa rencontre entre Coldplay et Nelson s'\u00e9tait effectu\u00e9e alors qu'ils donnaient un concert pour BBC Radio 1, \u00e0 Liverpool. Nelson sentit une ambiance \u00ab tendue \u00bb \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, alors que le groupe semblait \u00ab exp\u00e9dier le set, ce qui le rendait difficile \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier \u00bb. Les premiers essais en studio permirent donc au producteur d'apprendre au groupe \u00ab \u00e0 jouer chaque chanson sur le tempo qui lui convenait \u00bb, car il estimait simplement que le groupe avait besoin de se \"poser\".\n\nInitialement, l'album devait \u00eatre boucl\u00e9 en l'espace de 2 semaines, mais l'organisation de quelques tourn\u00e9es retarda les choses, et l'enregistrement s'\u00e9tala de novembre 1999 \u00e0 d\u00e9but-mai 2000. L'album fut commenc\u00e9 aux \"Rockfield Studios\" de Monmouth (Pays de Galles) et dans les mythiques \"Studios Wessex\" londoniens, mais la majorit\u00e9 y fut r\u00e9alis\u00e9e aux \"Parr Street Studios\", \u00e0 Liverpool, compos\u00e9s de 3 pi\u00e8ces principales, dans lesquelles l'\u00e9quipe \u00e9volua \u00e0 sa guise, bien que le \"project studio\" (\u00ab basiquement, une salle pour d\u00e9mos, mais qui reste un bon studio \u00bb, affirme Nelson) ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le t\u00e9moin de la majorit\u00e9 des enregistrements. High Speed, seule piste produite par Chris Allison et issue des quelques sessions du groupe \"Orinico Studios\" (Londres), fut \u00e9galement ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 l'album.\n\nLe mixage final, ainsi que celui des singles, fut int\u00e9gralement r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par Michael Brauer.\n\nAlors que Nelson avait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment choisi de laisser le groupe g\u00e9rer l'\u00e9laboration globale de leur cr\u00e9ation, il en ressortit une \u0153uvre finale tr\u00e8s \u00ab organique \u00bb, qui, selon ses propres mots, \u00ab poss\u00e8de un aspect tr\u00e8s \"vivant\"; que je caract\u00e9riserais par une \"\u00e2me\". On sent simplement qu'il y a \"quelque chose\" \u00bb.\n\nDe son c\u00f4t\u00e9, Will Champion, le batteur, estime que ce travail pr\u00e9sente un aspect paradoxal, \u00ab \u00e0 l'image du Perfect Day de Lou Reed. Les paroles y sont superbes, rayonnantes, mais la musique derri\u00e8re est extr\u00eamement triste. Tout repose la-dessus, quand on peut cr\u00e9er diff\u00e9rents \u00e9tats d'esprit entre la m\u00e9lodie et le texte. [...] \u00bb. De ce fait, le groupe d\u00e9mentit l'\u00e9tiquette d'album \"sombre et morose\" que leur avaient attribu\u00e9 un certain nombre de critiques. \u00ab Nous abordons la musique par son c\u00f4t\u00e9 optimiste, en quelque sorte \u00bb, conclut Champion.\n\nL'influence de Radiohead se ressent express\u00e9ment tout au long de l'album, en particulier vis-\u00e0-vis de leur OK Computer et de ses textures tr\u00e8s exp\u00e9rimentales. Fatalement, certains sugg\u00e8rent que le succ\u00e8s de \"Parachutes\" repose en grande partie sur la surprise g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9e autour de la sortie de Kid A, qui a d\u00e9rout\u00e9 une majorit\u00e9 de fans par le tournant musical qu'y emprunta Radiohead, et qui incita ce public \u00e0 se tourner vers le \"retour aux sources\" que pr\u00e9sentait le premier opus de Coldplay.\n\nLe globe de la pochette fut acquis au W H Smith pour 10\u00a3; on le retrouve dans les clips de Shiver, Don't Panic, ainsi que lors de plusieurs live du groupe.\n\nL'album est d\u00e9dicac\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00e8re de Will Champion, Dr. Sara Champion, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e d'un cancer en 2000.",

      "strReview": "Don\u2019t Coldplay love their Xs and their Ys? And their enigmatic album titles? After 2005\u2019s X&Y and 2008\u2019s Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends comes Mylo Xyloto. Well, it beats Coldplay 5. But any title that needs a pronunciation guide (it\u2019s \"My-lo zy-letoe\") sounds like it\u2019s trying a bit too hard. Maybe Chris Martin still yearns for something that infers the depth and gravitas of a Bono or Thom Yorke. The album is apparently a concept work, \"based on a love story with a happy ending,\" Martin claims, and inspired by old-school American graffiti and the anti-Nazi pacifist White Rose Movement: \"It's about being free to be yourself and to express yourself among negative surroundings.\" But the lyrics are still typically Martin\u2019s life-affirming, anthem-forming and plain-speaking as ever, more ABC than MYLO XYLOTO.\nThe same goes for the music. Bassist Guy Berryman said in 2009, \"It's time to take our music down different directions and really explore other avenues,\" and, in name alone, this set suggests Coldplay might finally do an Achtung Baby; they might rip it up and start again, in the presence of said U2 LP\u2019s producer Brian Eno, who also worked on Viva la Vida. If the addition of electronic undertows, instrumental snippets (the title-track, M.M.I.X., A Hopeful Transmission) linking many of the tracks and the presence of Rihanna on Princess of China count as \"other avenues\", then job well done. But Mylo Xyloto is much more a brilliant, shiny and emphatic reinstatement of the euphoric hooks and cuddly ballads that have served the band so well. Case in point: Paradise, where melting strings and church organ feed into a brilliant chorus line that equal parts Fix You and Viva la Vida\u2019s title-track. But the main vocal chorus doesn\u2019t arrive until over two minutes in, building the tension; the pay-off is both simple and devastating. It\u2019s the equal of Yellow, and when Coldplay return to Glastonbury it will take the roof off the sky.\nEvery Teardrop Is a Waterfall goes one step further than Paradise by lifting Vida la Vida\u2019s \"who-hoa!\" hook, suggesting Coldplay can\u2019t truly comprehend new avenues. U2-shaped echoes still run through the deep and wide canyons of their landscaped sound \u201d\u201c Major Minus features The Edge-patented guitar chatter, but it\u2019s nevertheless a triumph. Charlie Brown has one of those Coldplay-patented sun-breaking-through-clouds moments; Us Against the World (the sentiment that unites the graffiti and anti-Nazi camps) is the key wistful/cuddly ballad alongside Up in Flames, a successful grafting of soul onto the Coldplay model, helped by an understated falsetto and the simplest of piano parts (echoes of Parachutes\u2019 gorgeous Everything\u2019s Not Lost).\nThe closing Up With the Birds, which samples Leonard Cohen, is a serene finale that shows Coldplay understand the change of dynamics more than the dynamics of change. Better this than the nominally Euro-disco bent of Princess of China, where Rihanna\u2019s presence feels more of a marketing tool than a creative necessity, and there\u2019s yet another \"who-ay-oh-oh!\" chant just in case Coldplay were straying too far from their remit. This appears to support Martin\u2019s message of expressing the freedom to be yourself under negative surroundings \u201d\u201c not to change just because critics of the band tell them they should. Mylo Xyloto may have an oblique title but it\u2019s a triumph because the music is anything but.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, often referred to as simply Viva la Vida is the fourth studio album by British rock band Coldplay, released on 11 June 2008 on Parlophone. The album was named after a Spanish phrase that translates in English as \"long live life\". Lyrically, the album contains references to love, life, death, and war.\nRecording sessions for the album took place during June 2007 to April 2008 and featured production by Jon Hopkins, Rik Simpson, Markus Dravs and Brian Eno. The album was the first to be produced by the latter. The band forced themselves to explore experimental styles, as Eno required every song on the album to sound different, and expanded their musical interests while recording Viva la Vida. The band wanted to make the album shorter than 42 minutes. As a result, the album is longer than the length they intended. Development of the album delayed the release date several times.\nViva la Vida was both a critical and commercial success. Five singles have been released in promotion of the album; \"Violet Hill\" and \"Viva la Vida\" in May 2008, \"Lovers in Japan\" and \"Lost!\" in November 2008, and \"Strawberry Swing\" in September 2009. \"Viva la Vida\" became the band's first song to reach number one in both the United States and the United Kingdom. It won Best Rock Album at the 2009 Grammy Awards and was also nominated for Album of the Year. \nIt was the best selling album of 2008. To date, the album has sold more than 10 million copies. Viva la Vida was re-released on 25 November 2008 in a deluxe edition containing the original album and the Prospekt's March EP.",

      "strReview": "Paradoxically everything that fuels cynicism about the stadium-proof nature of Coldplay is also what makes them undeniably great. Yes, if you find huge choruses that contain wordless exhortations, ponderous one note bass lines and vaporous lyrics that convey nameless heartache to be the very tools of Satan, then Viva La Vida has much to wind you up. If, however, you're one of their millions of fans then it's an unqualified triumph. The rest of us (and EMI, for whom, allegedly, their very future depends on this selling by the shedload) can also rest easy. For, by bringing Brian Eno onboard as sonic nurse, Coldplay have managed to effortlessly make a record that's accomplished and yet pulls off the same trick that U2 managed when they employed the bald one - massaging their sound into something different enough to keep the formula (and make no mistake it IS a formula) fresh.\nTwo years in gestation, with a break in the middle to do a bit of cultural tourism (and touring) in South America, Viva La Vida wrong foots you by starting with Life In Technicolour; an instrumental that reeks of Eno's ambience while also utilising something that sounds suspiciously like a zither. The world music tropes are limited however. Cemeteries Of London may have an off-kilter rhythmic undertow and Lost! seems to sport bongos in its mix, yet it's the plaintive voice with its vague sense of regret, the lifts from minor key piano forays into vast, pumping rock and also a strident optimism that people are going to come here for. The band deliver all this in spades: 42 and Death And All His Friends most notably.\nElsewhere it's that patent (and potent) mix of upbeat and fatalistic that reminds you why the band hit the bullseye every time. Only on Strawberry Swing does Chris' chirpiness start to grate. \n\nIt all sounds so easy, yet when you imagine the pressure on all concerned to deliver the goods, it's little short of miraculous. Again, cynics may argue that it's Eno's fourth world fairy dust that sugar coats songs that really don't live up to Martin's promise of a very different sound. The string/brass mutations that bolster a track like Viva La Vida may not be a million miles from his mates, The Arcade Fire, but I bet they'd donate several limbs to conjure tunes so sweetly melancholy. Any way you look at it, this is a massive album. Get used to it, you'll be hearing it a LOT over the next two years.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "X&Y is the third studio album by British rock band Coldplay, released 6 June 2005 in the United Kingdom via the record label Parlophone. The album, which features influences of electronic music, was produced by the band and British record producer Danton Supple. Development of the album was often troubled; the album's original producer, British record producer Ken Nelson, was supposed to produce much of the album, however, many songs written during their sessions were ditched due to the band's dissatisfaction. The album's cover art is a combination of colours and blocks, which is a representation of the Baudot code.\n\nThe album contains twelve tracks and an additional hidden track, \"Til Kingdom Come\". It is omitted from the track listing on the album sleeve, but listed as \"+\" on the disc label and inside the album booklet. It was originally planned for American singer-songwriter Johnny Cash to record it with Martin, but Cash died before he was able to do so. The song \"Talk\" appeared on the main track listing, although it was thought to have been downgraded to a B-side for the album's subsequent single releases, after it leaked online in early 2005.\n\nOriginally titled Zero Theory, X&Y was released after a considerable amount of hype and was a significant commercial success, reaching the top spot of many charts worldwide, including the United Kingdom and United States, the latter being their first. With accumulated sales of 8.3 million units in 2005 alone, X&Y was the best-selling album released in 2005 worldwide. The album has sold over 12 million copies worldwide.\n\nOverall reaction to the album has been generally positive, though some critics cited it as being inferior to its predecessors. The album has spawned the singles \"Speed of Sound\", \"Fix You\", \"Talk\", \"The Hardest Part\", and \"White Shadows\".",

      "strReview": "You've heard the single, read the reviews and listened to the interviews; everything suggests Coldplay's new album is going to be great. But it's not until you hear the first few bars of the opening track that you know that the band are going to achieve everything they hoped and dreamed of.\nThis album is superb. It'll silence their critics, amaze their fans and win them a whole new legion of admirers. It might even bring about world peace! I'm sure that was one of Chris Martin's objectives for this album...\n\"Square One\" opens the record in typically anthemic fashion: 'Is there anywhere you want to go? The future's for discovering'. Martin has the knack of writing lyrics that affect individuals on a massive scale. Thousands have fallen for his simple songs about hope, loss, love and happiness. X&Y is full of touching eulogiessuch as \"A Message\" and \"Swallowed In The Sea\" which express complete and honest love for a partner.\nMuch has been made of Coldplay challenging U2's title of biggest band in the world. Martin may spend a great deal of time emulating Bono by talking to politicians and canvassing support for his causes but, unlike Bono, these issues haven't crept into his songwriting. There are no protest songs here.\nOn this record Martin proves once again that he's an excellent singer while Buckland has become, according to Chris, a 'guitar hero'. Add bass player Guy Berryman and drummer Will Champion and you have four great musicians. Their powers peak on \"Talk\", a fantastic song that is, on an album of big songs, positively gargantuan. More evidence that Coldplay are far and away the best at what they do. Imitators such as Thirteen Senses, Keane and Longview can't touch them.\nOther album highlights include \"Low\", perhaps the most frantic song they've recorded, which features some awesome guitar licks. And the secret final track, \"'Til Kingdom Come\", where the threadbare acoustic guitar contrasts wonderfully with the big album sound.\nMartin has repeatedly spoken of howhe loves every minute of being in Coldplay. His passion is genuine; he's living his dream, making music he loves and playing live to thousands of adoring fans every night. And Martin is doing all this with his three best mates. Coldplay are a closely knit group of musicians, a band of men with one aim -to make the best music in the world. On the epic X&Y they're on the brink of achieving that goal.",

The CD version was re-released with identical packaging in 2001, thereby making it more widely available.

On 5 November, Coldplay offered an exclusive preview of the EP via their Facebook application and through their website.\n\nThere were two singles that anchored the EP. The song \"Glass of Water\" entered the iTunes Top 100 songs and went on to be performed live by the band on 4Music. \"Life in Technicolor II\" began its existence in the charts at #90 in the UK Singles Chart despite not being released as an official single. It was later confirmed to be the EP's first single. It later peaked at #28 upon its physical release on 8 February 2009. The song was nominated at the 52nd Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Short Form Music Video.\n\nAs of January 2010, Prospekt's March has sold 537,000 copies worldwide.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Ghost Stories is the sixth studio album by British rock band Coldplay. The album, co-produced by the band with Paul Epworth along with returning Mylo Xyloto producers Daniel Green, and Rik Simpson, was released by Parlophone on 16 May 2014. The album was released by Atlantic Records in North America on 19 May 2014. It is the first full-length release by the band in North America under Atlantic, after Coldplay were transferred from Capitol Records in 2013, following the purchase of EMI and its assets by the Universal Music Group in 2012.\nGhost Stories, partly inspired by lead singer Chris Martin's troubled relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow at the time of the album's recording, is a concept album that tells the story of a man going through a dramatic and sudden breakup, with the narrative following the man's various emotional states leading up to his eventual acceptance of the situation. The album revolves around a central theme of \"opening yourself up to love\", and accepting that love does not last forever. The album was recorded by the band throughout 2012 and 2013 at the band's purpose-built home studios in London, England, and features guest producers Avicii, Timbaland and Madeon, in addition to the band's frequent collaborator, Jon Hopkins. The album is packaged with original etchings by Mila F\u00fcrstov\u00e1, created specifically for the album.\nThe album was heavily promoted by the band and Parlophone in the lead-up to its release, with an accompanying prime time TV special, a visual album and a six-date promotional tour of the album, as well as various appearances on television and radio. The album was further promoted by three singles: \"Magic\", released in March, \"Midnight\", released in April, and \"A Sky Full of Stars\", released in May 2014.\nIn 2011, Coldplay released their fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto. Originally conceived by the band as a \"stripped-down, more acoustic collection\", it became one of Coldplay's most experimental and pop-oriented records to date, being described as \"luxuriously colourful\" where \"the choruses are bigger, the textures grander  the optimism more optimistic.\" Produced by Markus Dravs, Brian Eno, Rik Simpson and Dan Green, the album peaked at #1 on 18 national album charts and certified Platinum in 16 different countries. Mylo Xyloto had also sold 8 million copies within the first year of release. Coldplay's 2011 single, \"Paradise\", became the band's second UK #1 single after 2008's \"Viva la Vida\". Coldplay's subsequent world tour in promotion of Mylo Xyloto visited North America, Europe, Australasia and Africa, raising over 100 million in revenue.\nGoing into the creative process for their sixth studio album, the band wanted to return to the \"stripped-down, more acoustic collection\" they had stated their fifth album would be, returning to the original idea of an acoustic-oriented album, with less of the production and sound that made Mylo Xyloto.",

Sorti le 19 mai 2014, l'album a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 entre l'ann\u00e9e 2013 et le d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e 2014.\nLe 27 f\u00e9vrier 2014, Coldplay d\u00e9voile discr\u00e8tement une nouvelle chanson intitul\u00e9e Midnight. Le titre est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 avec un clip r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par Mary Wigmore.\n\nLa chanson, tout comme le clip, surprend de nombreux fans par le style tr\u00e8s \u00e9nigmatique du morceau et de la vid\u00e9o qui l'accompagne, ainsi que par le virage musical que Coldplay semble, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, avoir pris.\n\nLe 3 mars 2014, le groupe d\u00e9voile le titre du nouvel album, Ghost Stories et lance le 1er single officiel, Magic. Le m\u00eame jour, l'album est disponible en pr\u00e9commande sur la plateforme de t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement iTunes. Vingt jours avant la sortie officielle de l'album, Coldplay r\u00e9v\u00e8le leur deuxi\u00e8me single, A Sky Full of Stars.\n\nUne semaine avant la sortie mondiale de Ghost Stories, le groupe britannique offre la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00e9couter la totalit\u00e9 de l'album via la plateforme musicale iTunes. Cette \u00e9coute est accompagn\u00e9e d'une vid\u00e9o pr\u00e9sentant une animation des cr\u00e9ations de Mila Furstova, l'artiste \u00e0 l'origine des illustrations de ce 6e album.\n\u00c0 travers les deux premiers extraits, l'album marque un retour aux sources pour le groupe, avec un style plus \u00e9pur\u00e9 que celui adopt\u00e9 sur Mylo Xyloto notamment, mais avec une touche beaucoup plus \u00e9lectronique. L'omnipr\u00e9sence du synth\u00e9tiseur dans l'album marque un changement de style du groupe, avec une musique plus \u00ab futuriste \u00bb et des m\u00e9lodies plus complexes.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Ghost Stories Live 2014 is the fourth live album and a concert film by British alternative rock band Coldplay. The album, a live recorded version of the band's sixth studio album Ghost Stories, was released by Parlophone in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2014. A DVD from one of the \"Ghost Stories\" concerts that was filmed at Sony Studios, Los Angeles in March 2014, is included with the Live CD. The performance was previously shown on NBC, however it differs from the TV special as it only includes the performances of the songs from Ghost Stories and the NBC special only featured 6 songs from Ghost Stories and the previous hits, \"Clocks,\" \"Viva la Vida,\" and \"Paradise.\" According to the band's official website, it was filmed by Grammy-nominated director Paul Dugdale, in a custom-built amphitheatre at Sony Studios, Los Angeles, the ground-breaking production sets the band\u2019s performance against stunning 360-degree and overhead imagery.\n\nIt has been nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Music Film category.\n\nFollowing the studio album by a matter of months instead of years, Ghost Stories: Live 2014 preserves Coldplay's supporting tour for their 2014 album, Ghost Stories. Unlike many live albums, this record isn't a stroll through the band's back pages. Instead, this provides live versions of each of the nine songs from Ghost Stories, all cobbled together from performances given in London, Sydney, Paris, New York City, Cologne, and Los Angeles. Ghost Stories isn't an especially kinetic album and its original incarnation emphasizes studio textures, some of which are captured in concert; there are synths and perhaps hints of tapes as well. Overall, Coldplay resist the temptation to give these meditative songs muscle, nor do they rush the tempos, which means Ghost Stories: Live 2014 merely feels bright and open -- a nice distinction for the hardcore fans who are the real audience for this pleasant package.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "A Head Full of Dreams is the seventh studio album by British rock band Coldplay. It was released on 4 December 2015 by Parlophone and Atlantic Records. It is the second album by the band in North America under Atlantic, after Coldplay were transferred from Capitol Records America in 2013.\n\nFor various songs on the album, Coldplay collaborated with Beyonc\u00e9, Noel Gallagher, Tove Lo, Khatia Buniatishvili and Merry Clayton. The album was produced by Rik Simpson and Stargate. Coldplay have also revealed that the album features a sample of the U.S. President Barack Obama singing \"Amazing Grace\" at Clementa C. Pinckney's funeral on the track \"Kaleidoscope\".\n\nColdplay began working on A Head Full of Dreams in the summer of 2014 while they were promoting their sixth album Ghost Stories. In an interview with Radio 2 DJ Jo Whiley in December 2014, bassist Guy Berryman and guitarist Jonny Buckland gave a hint as to the difference between A Head Full of Dreams and its predecessor \u2013 Buckland called it the \"night to the day\", comparing the style of Ghost Stories to the expected uplifting theme of A Head Full of Dreams. Frontman Chris Martin hinted at the style of the album by saying that the band was trying to make something colourful and uplifting. He also stated that it would be something to \"shuffle your feet\" to.\n\nOn 26 September 2015, the band performed at the Global Citizen Festival 2015 in New York City, playing a six-song set, including a new song called \"Amazing Day\". The band's producer Rik Simpson confirmed that the song would be on the new album.\n\nThe album has been produced by Rik Simpson (the band's longterm collaborator) and Norwegian duo Stargate (Tor Hermansen and Mikkel Eriksen). Mixing duties were carried out predominately by Rik Simpson. Stargate executive produced the album.",

Opening track \u2018All I Can Think About Is You\u2019 begins as a dusky, ambient Radiohead art-throb in which a muffled Martin mumbles about \u201cchaos giving orders\u201d, sounding as if he\u2019s hiding underwater from the political nightmares of 2017. Then, three minutes in, familiar \u2018Clocks\u2019 piano chords kick in and the tune becomes a celestial scream of adoration, love rising above Trumpageddon.  Aliens, a collaboration with Brian Eno, is even more outr\u00e9, mingling Spanish guitar with space-age synths. These five tracks climax with \u2018Hypnotised\u2019, a solemn country swooner resembling John Lennon\u2019s \u2018Mother\u2019, easily their best barnstorming ballad since \u2018Fix You\u2019. It\u2019s heartening evidence that Coldplay haven\u2019t entirely been sucked into the machinery while trying to subvert pop music from within. Is it too much to hope that their Avicii period was the experiment, and this the return to the norm?   -- Reviewed by  nme.com\n",

It was later re-released as an EP. The song has peaked at number 92 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nBackground: After forming in 1998, Coldplay met up with local record label Fierce Panda Records after a representative from said label saw them perform at the Camden Falcon in December of that year. Fierce Panda offered to release their debut single, and the band agreed, signing a short record deal.\n\nRecording: According to the single's liner notes, recording completed in only four days and cost the band a lowly sum of \u00a3400. The atmospheric sounds on \"Easy to Please\" were created by setting up microphones on a wet road outside the studio.\n\nRelease: 1,500 copies of the vinyl single were issued in a special wrap-around picture sleeve. The single was re-released as an EP in late 2002 on Brash Records.\n\nVersions: There are three versions, one from 1998, another from 1999, and a last one from 2000, being the version of this release the second one. The first and original can be found on the Ode To Deodorant promo cassette, and the third one later appeared on the \"Trouble\" single as part of the Parachutes record sessions.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "\"Trouble\" was released as the third single off Coldplay's debut album Parachutes (2000) ,on 26 October 2000 in the United Kingdom, and more than a year later on 18 December 2001 in the United States.\n\nIt reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, making it the band's second top 10 single in the country. Although \"Trouble\" failed to chart on the United States, the music press deemed it almost as successful as its predecessor, \"Yellow\". In Iceland the song peaked at number 1. Two different music videos for the single were released.\n\nThe band wrote the song and co-produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson. The song's arrangement is built around the acoustic piano.\n\nAn associated EP titled Trouble \u2013 Norwegian Live EP was released in the summer of 2001, consisted of five tracks recorded live by the band at Rockefeller Music Hall in Oslo, Norway.\n\nProduction:\n\nAccording to Coldplay's lead singer Chris Martin, the song's writing was inspired by his own behaviour. Martin recalls, \"There were some bad things going in our band ... the song is about behaving badly towards somebody you really love and I was certainly doing that to some members of the band.\" He added that he supposed it was about time to stop acting like a knobhead. The four members of Coldplay are credited as co-writers of \"Trouble\".\n\nBritish record producer Ken Nelson and the band produced \"Trouble\" for their debut album, Parachutes. The track was recorded four times before the band got the take they preferred. The backing track was first recorded, and each time they add to see if it was working. They, however, decided that the first three versions were not \"working\". The last take was recorded into Pro Tools with a shaker to provide the rhythm to the track. For the backing track, Will Champion played the drums and Martin on the piano which they recorded in a little wooden room. After Guy Berryman's bass was recorded, guitarist Jonny Buckland added the guitar section. In recording the piano section of the track, the band used two microphones\u2014one was brighter-sounding and the other had a fuller sound. Nelson, who wanted to keep the song simple, chose the fuller sound microphone for the mixing.\n\n\"Trouble\" was mixed in New York by American mix engineer Michael Brauer. The initial mixed version, which was sent back to the band and Nelson, fell short of their desired quality, so it had to be redone. According to Nelson, \"the vocal was overcompressed and the piano was too bright\". Despite this, Nelson did not blame Brauer because he was recording the album when the track was being mixed.\n\nComposition:\n\nThe song's lyrics have \"softer emotional themes\", including apologies, unrequited love, and longing. Its musicscape follows the minimalistic approach. \"Trouble\" is built around a piano, with a snare drum background that was mixed very low. The snare drum section tends to be inaudible when the guitars come in. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes, Inc., the song's time signature follows the common 4/4, with a tempo of 70 beats per minute. Martin's vocal range in the song spans from F\u266f3 to A4, the highest note being sung using the falsetto register, despite the fact Martin can reach this note in full voice.\n\nAs they have for their other songs, Coldplay has refused to accept several offers to use \"Trouble\" for promotional tools. In 2004, the band rejected a multi-million Euro offer from Diet Coke and Gap to use the song and \"Don't Panic\", the fourth single from the album. They asked manager Phil Harvey to not refer such offers to them because \"a discussion might lead to compromise\". American actor Sylvester Stallone was interested to use the song for the soundtrack of his 2001 film Driven, but the band declined. The song was used in the season 1 finale of the FX television series The Shield.\n\nMusic videos:\n\nThe original European version of the music video for \"Trouble\" was directed by British director Sophie Muller. The video footage was shot in a Newhall, California ranch. A Wild West-themed video, it features Martin as a prisoner in a dark warehouse, tied with ropes to a chair, being circled by cars in the freezing cold. The other members of the band are seen on the upper floor in a slow motion sequence where Buckland and Champion struggle with bass guitarist Guy Berryman, tying him to another chair and forcing him to look in front. At this point, Martin's struggling causes his chair to tip over, and he hits the ground on his side. He sings the final line of the song (\"They spun a web for me...\"), before the darkness abruptly turns to daylight. A beautiful sunrise is then revealed, but as the camera pans out, it is revealed to be fake and part of a large theatre backdrop, with Martin still lying on his side, tied to the chair.\n\nA US version of the music video was directed by Tim Hope. The video employs a dream-like animated world, with woodland glades, cartoon flowers which bloom instantly and the air full of clockwork-like insects and birds, but with real people embedded within it. On top of a mountain, a woman (Nerys Davies) waters plants inside a house. The band are aboard a horse carriage that travels through a rural landscape. A small coloured bird flies from the carriage up to the house, lands on the woman's windowsill and flaps its wings as if delivering a message. It transforms into a crow and then into a huge black menacing bird. The bird flies over the house and turns into a black cloud, which pours rain onto the land. The rain burns holes on the things it falls on, and crow feathers protrude from the holes. Finally a tornado lifts up the house, spinning it across the sky and then dropping it precisely on a normal suburban street. The video's acclaimed visuals earned Hope an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002. It was also nominated for Breakthrough Video.",

      "strReview": "\"Trouble\" was a commercial success. It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, making it the band's second top 10 single in the United Kingdom after \"Yellow\". The performance of \"Trouble\" has been attributed to the \"colossal home sales\" of Parachutes in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe positive reception of the single continued when the British outfit Lost Witness made a remixed version of the song, which was released and became \"an unlikely dance floor anthem\". With three singles successfully released, the band decided to abandon their initial plans of issuing \"Don't Panic\" as the fourth single of the album, deemed enough for a single album in the United Kingdom. \"Don't Panic\", however, was eventually released in some European regions.\n\nIn the United States, the single's chart performance was nearly as successful as that of \"Yellow\"'s. It has reached number 23 on the Billboard Adult Top 40 and 28 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks. Martin has claimed that the single had saved them from being a \"one-hit wonder\" band. The band, thinking it was not a \"great single\", surmised it would not perform well in the United States.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "\"Yellow\" and \"Shiver\" were initially released as EPs in the spring of 2000 along with the songs \"Help Is Round the Corner\" and \"No More Keeping My Feet on the Ground\", the third taken from the band's first EP, Safety. In the United States, the song was released as the lead single from the album. In October 2000, the track was sent to US college and alternative radio outlets. The band released a limited-edition CD of \"Trouble\", the third single from Parachutes, which features a remix of \"Yellow\". It was pressed to 1,000 copies, and was issued only to fans and journalists.\n\nGeneral Info:\n\n\"Yellow\" was written by the band and co-produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson for their debut album, Parachutes (2000).\n\nThe song was recorded in March 2000, and released in June that same year as the second single from Parachutes, following Shiver, and the lead single in the United States. \"Yellow\" reached number four in the UK Singles Chart, giving Coldplay their first top-five hit in the United Kingdom. Helped by heavy rotation and usage in promotions, the song thrust the band into popularity. \"Yellow\" has since been covered by various recording artists worldwide, and remains one of the band's most popular songs.\n\nBackground and inspiration:\n\n\"Yellow\" was written in Rockfield studio in Wales called the Quadrangle, where Coldplay began working on their debut album, Parachutes. One night after finishing recording \"Shiver\", the band took a break and went out of the studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and \"just amazing\", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously \"as he relayed the tune to the rest of the band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice\". Martin has said, \"The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice.\" The melody \"started off a lot slower\", according to drummer Will Champion, and it sounded like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When guitarist Jonny Buckland started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the riff, \"and it sort of got a bit heavier\".\n\nWhile composing the song's lyrics, Martin could not find the right words. He was thinking of a specific word, which he deemed a missing key word in the lyrics, to fit the song's concept. He looked around the studio and saw Stephanie, a friend who happened to be present in the studio at that time. Martin later titled the song \"Yellow\" as a reference to Stephanie's yellow glow. The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. Bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line \"Look at the stars\". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.\n\nA much different origin of the song was told on The Howard Stern Show in November 2011. Chris Martin explained to Stern that he was impersonating Neil Young while entertaining guests when he came across the first chord of the song, which stuck with him for a bit; then in a Neil Young voice he sang \"look at the stars\". Martin went on to further explain that the word \"yellow\" has absolutely no meaning whatsoever and while writing the rest of the song he tried his best to change \"yellow\" to something else since every lyric before yellow made no sense but in the end the word \"yellow\" just sounded right. Martin also told Stern that through the years depending on the attitude and manner of whoever interviews him, he would make up some story about a song or album titles just to move on to the next question. Martin applauded Stern saying \"I like you, Howard, so that's the first time I've ever told anyone the truth behind 'Yellow'.\"\n\nRecording and production:\n\nThe band and Nelson produced the track. Nelson was acquainted with the band's music through the former's manager. Nelson's manager gave him a copy of an EP and single by Coldplay, and showed interest in working with them after seeing the band perform live. \"Yellow\" was initially recorded upstairs in the project studio, basically a demo room in Liverpool's Parr Street Studios. The track was later mixed in New York City.\n\nNelson and the band encountered problems in producing some aspects of the song. According to Champion, \"... it was really difficult to record, because it worked at about five or six different tempos. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging...\" The band was trying to get the right tempo, according to Nelson, \"because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same groove\". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson and the band were happy at the output. The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle.\n\nNelson used an analogue 2-inch type tape in recording most of the tracks in the album. As recording progressed, \"Yellow\" was one of a couple of songs that they \"couldn't quite get on analogue\". They recorded different versions but it did not satisfy their taste. So Nelson used Pro Tools \"to get the feel of  just right\"; once all takes were recorded into the computer, \"we then put it down to the 2-inch, which I found was a great way to do it\", according to Nelson.\n\nRelease:\n\n The single, accompanied by its TV reception through its music video, received massive radio airplay, particularly at BBC Radio 1. The reaction was chiefly positive and even the newly revitalised BBC Radio 2 played the track repeatedly. This heavy rotation continued for months after its release, eventually ending as 2000's most-aired song. A month after the album was released in the United States via record label Nettwerk, \"Yellow\" was used as the theme song for ABC autumn television promotions. The song was also used as the theme music for The Cancer Council Australia's \"Daffodil Day\", in recognition of that organisation's official flower's yellow hue.\n\nCritical reception\"\n\nThe song was well received by music critics. Matt Diehl of Rolling Stone Magazine has noted \"Yellow\" is \"unrepentantly romantic\", adding that \"the band creates a hypnotic slo-mo otherworld where spirit rules supreme\". \"Yellow\" won Best Single at the 2001 NME Carling Awards. It was nominated at the 2002 Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Billboard said that \"every time that electric-guitar riff barges in, you're hooked all over again.\" In August 2009 the song was listed at #263 on Pitchfork Media's \"Top 500 songs of the 2000s\". In October 2011, NME placed it at number 139 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".\n\nChart performance\"\n\n\"Yellow\" played well in Europe, and was popular. In the United Kingdom, its midweek sales suggested that the single would reach the Top 10 of the chart. Although the band supposed \"Yellow\" would decline inside the Top 20, they would have considered its performance a triumph since the album's lead single, \"Shiver\", had only reached the 35th position. Since \"Yellow\"'s second week sales were stronger, it eventually reached number four, giving the band their first Top 10 single in the United Kingdom. The popularity of the song in British clubs, pubs and sporting events bolstered the album to debut at number one on the UK Albums Chart. As of February 2015, the song has sold 530,000 copies in the UK.\n\n\"Yellow\" achieved popularity in the United States, and was Coldplay's first American hit. The single charted on eight different Billboard singles charts; it also topped various US modern-rock radio playlists in the spring of 2001. The single performed as it did in Europe and has helped Parachutes be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America during the single's stay on the chart. As of October 2014, the song has sold over 2 million copies in the US.\n\nAfter Coldplay's appearance at Sound Relief in Australia, In the charting week starting 22 March 2009, the single made a return to the Australian ARIA Top 50, after almost eight years since its last appearance in the Top 50. It re-entered the chart at number 48.\n\nMusic video:\n\nThe music video for \"Yellow\" was filmed at Studland Bay in the county of Dorset, South West England. The video is minimalistic, featuring only Martin singing the song as he walks along the beach. He is seen wearing a set of waterproofs with his hair wet, suggesting that it had just rained. The video is one continuous shot with no cuts. The entire sequence is in slow motion.\n\nOriginally, it had been intended for the whole band to appear in the video, in a sunny setting. Champion's mother's funeral was held on the day of the shooting, so it was decided that only Martin would appear in the video, which was also the immediate explanation of his mood during this part. The weather also opposed the original plan, with harsh winds and rain instead of the sunny day that had been envisioned. It had also been originally intended for there to be moving stars in the sky, as if in a time-lapse. The directors agreed that the moving stars would distract the focus of the video from Martin. The plan of time advancing was kept. The video begins with the beach being somewhat dark until sunlight arrives nearly at the video's midway point.\n\nThe video was directed by British directing duo James Frost & Alex Smith of The Artists Company. It was shot at 50 frames per second, twice the regular speed. At the shoot, Chris Martin had to sing the song at double speed so that the audio and visual content would be in sync, a common yet difficult practice of music videos. The final product is slowed to 25 frames per second, giving the slow motion effect of the video. The transition of the video from night to day was achieved during the telecine process. During the transfer from film to videotape, an operator manually adjusted from a monochromatic, grainy look at the start, to a warm, colorful and bright look at the end of the video. The look was inspired by the night swimming scenes in the movie Jaws.\n\nLive performances:\n\nColdplay performing \"Yellow\" in 2006 during the Twisted Logic tour, with yellow balloons falling\nColdplay have performed the song throughout their career, and it is a firm audience favourite. The song had its debut performance on television on the show Later...with Jools Holland. They performed Parachutes's lead single, \"Shiver\", and the new song, \"Yellow\"; but it was the latter that had an immediate studio audience impact. They have also performed it at the Glastonbury Festival, one of the prominent festivals in Europe. During their second appearance in July 2000, Coldplay performed \"Yellow\" and \"effortlessly\" captured over 10,000 spectators. Coldplay's popularity at this time was still growing and \"Yellow\" has helped cultivate it; Martin has said it was the best day of their year. During most concert performances, large yellow balloons are dropped on the audience. The first known sighting of yellow balloons was on 24 September 2002 at the UIC Pavilion in Chicago. Chris Martin noticed the balloons in the air with a surprised look. In more recent years, (January 2013) the balloons are filled with confetti, and at the end of the song Chris Martin would pop one with his guitar causing confetti to fly everywhere.\n\nA live acoustic version performed on Jo Whiley's The Lunchtime Social was included on the Acoustic EP. Another live version featuring only piano and vocals performed and broadcast in Los Angeles on KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic was included on the Japanese Clocks EP. Most recently an acoustic piano version the song was recorded in the studio for Starbucks charity compilation album Every Mother Counts 2012.\n\nColdplay performed the song at the Celebrating Steve event at the Apple campus on 16 October 2011. Before the performance, Martin revealed that, when they first played it for Steve Jobs 10 years ago, Jobs said the song was \"shit\" and that \"they would never make it\". The song was later performed on 7 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany with guest vocals from Shakira.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "\"Don't Panic\" is a song by the British rock band Coldplay. Originally titled \"Panic\", the earliest known version of the song existed in 1998, performed live during the band's first gig in the same year. It had a different melody, and was included in the band's third EP, The Blue Room. The track was reproduced by Coldplay and British producer Ken Nelson for the band's debut album, Parachutes.\n\nFollowing their successful releases in 2000, Coldplay and their record label Parlophone thought there was enough exposure of the album in the United Kingdom. Thus, the decision of releasing a fourth single would be for regions that had not been overdosed by the hit singles \"Yellow\" and \"Trouble\". They settled on \"Don't Panic\", which at the time was an audience favourite. The single was released in some European regions, and the United Kingdom only received a promo edition. The critical reception of the song was generally positive.\n\nOrigins and production:\n\"Don't Panic\" came into existence while Coldplay was still in its infancy. In the time, the band had written 10 songs including an early version of \"Don't Panic\", and used it in recruiting the band's drummer. It was originally called \"Panic\", and was one of six songs played at Coldplay's first gig in 1998 at Camden's Laurel Tree. This version has a different melody, and the lyrics are an account of a \"slightly disastrous evening Chris had spent entertaining a young lady called Alice Hill\". Eventually, the title became \"Don't Panic.\"\n\nThe original version of \"Don't Panic\" was recorded in 1999, different from the version featured in Parachutes. First, lead singer Chris Martin plays the piano during the bridge. As well, there is a feedback-distorted introduction. This version was included in The Blue Room EP, released in October 1999.\n\nFor Coldplay's debut album Parachutes (2000), British record producer Ken Nelson re-produced \"Don't Panic\". The track was recorded live, like many other tracks featured in the album. Guitarist Jonny Buckland recorded twice his overdubbed guitars, and used parts of the two during the mixing. The band subtly used the acoustic guitar, drums and bass, and also a pump organ. Buckland also provides vocals for the second verse of the song. The song was recorded in Rockfield Studios, Wales and Parr Street Studio, Liverpool.\n\n\"Don't Panic\" is the opening track to Parachutes. A guitar-based song, it begins with strummed acoustic guitar riffs, then followed by the vocals of Chris Martin.  A review claims that Coldplay's indie rock inclination is obvious in the song. The verse melody is similar to 'Things' by Split Enz (1979).\n\nRelease and reception\n\nColdplay performing \"Don't Panic\" live during the Twisted Logic Tour\nOriginally, the band planned to release \"Don't Panic\" as Parachutes' fourth single. However, it was abandoned after they deemed three singles were enough for an album. Following the successful single releases of the album in 2000, the band thought that Parachutes had gained enough exposure in significant regions in the United Kingdom. When they decided to release a fourth single, it would be for countries yet not \"overdosed\" by the hit singles \"Yellow\" and \"Trouble\". Coldplay and their record label, Parlophone, settled on \"Don't Panic\", which at the time was an audience favorite. The single was eventually released on 19 March 2001 in some European regions. The single is accompanied by the live tracks \"You Only Live Twice\", a theme song for the James Bond film of the same name, and \"Bigger Stronger\", a song taken from the band's first EP release; these live tracks were recorded during their performance at the Rockefeller Music Hall in Norway.\n\nLike their other songs, Coldplay has refused several offers to use \"Don't Panic\" for promotional tools. In 2004, the band rejected a multi-million Euro offer from Diet Coke and Gap to use \"Don't Panic\" and \"Trouble\", another song featured in the album. The band asked then-manager Phil Harvey to not refer them to such offers because \"a discussion might lead to compromise\".\n\nDespite this, the song has been used in many promotional tools and featured in several films and television series. In 2002, the song was featured in the comedy-drama film Igby Goes Down, and later appeared on the film's soundtrack album, released on 25 February 2003 by Spun Records. Also in 2003, the song was also featured on Coldplay's live album Live 2003. In 2004, it was on the romantic comedy film Garden State; director Zach Braff handpicked songs, including \"Don't Panic\", for the film's Grammy Award-winning compilation album, Garden State: Music From The Motion Picture. The song was also featured on the debut episode of the FX television series Rescue Me as well as the pilot episode of the short-lived show Odyssey 5. Additionally, the song was featured in episode nine of the first series on the British TV series Sugar Rush in 2005. On 19 July 2011, the song was played as a wake-up call to STS-135 Space Shuttle Atlantis Pilot Doug Hurley as a tribute from his wife and family, marking the last ever wake-up call for a crew visiting the International Space Station from the Space Shuttle fleet. It was also referenced in the 2016 movie The 5th Wave as a lullaby to the main character's little brother. In February 2016, a cover of the song by Clairity was used in the trailer for the 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse, as well as the film's TV spot for the Super Bowl 50. This same cover was used in the seventh season finale of The CW series The Vampire Diaries (Gods and Monsters).\n\nDuring the band's 2003 A Rush of Blood to the Head Tour, \"Don't Panic\" contained an entirely different introduction. In addition, Martin played the electric guitar and Buckland in harmonica solo during the bridge. He regularly threw the harmonica into the crowd after the solo. In 2001, a dance cover version of \"Don't Panic\" was released by Logo featuring Dawn Joseph.\n\nDuring performances of \"Don't Panic\", Martin would stop the song after Buckland performs his verse and make him perform it a second time. Buckland jokingly stated in an interview with Business Times that he wanted the practice dropped, saying, \"I don't think I would dread it so much if he didn't (sometimes) make me do it twice.\" Performances during 2017 legs of A Head Full of Dreams Tour would feature drummer Will Champion as lead vocalist.",

      "strReview": "Upon release, critics gave the song generally positive reviews. MacKenzie Wilson, in his review from Allmusic, notes, \"Coldplay's indie rock inclinations are also obvious, especially on songs such as 'Don't Panic' and 'Shiver'.\" In the Pitchfork Media review, Spencer Owen writes, \"This subdued, dreamy opener contains Martin's falsetto chorus of 'We live in a beautiful world,' which seems to sum up the overall sentiment of the record.\" Robert Christgau alleged that, along with \"Yellow\", the song was one of only two good ones on all of Parachutes. Critic Adrian Denning, in his review of the album, compliments, \"Both the vocals and guitar are utterly beautiful. It's a song to take solace from, draw comfort from, be quietly awed by.\" David DeVoe of Hybridmagazine.com wrote: \"It is a wonderful song that echoes the promise of what is to come on the rest of the record. 'Don\u2019t Panic' is filled with excellent guitar tones and a nice grooving back beat, and I love the way the song ends.\"",

      "strDescriptionEN": "\"Shiver\" is a song by British rock band Coldplay. British record producer Ken Nelson and Coldplay produced the track for their debut album Parachutes. Lead singer Chris Martin admitted that \"Shiver\" was written for a specific woman, from whom the media has generated several speculations. The song contains influences attributed to American singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley, whom Coldplay's early influences were drawn from. The song's lyrics are a reference to the band's lead singer Chris Martin's unrequited love.\n\nThe song was released as the album's lead single in the United Kingdom, and second in the United States following the hit single \"Yellow\". The single reached number 35 on the UK Singles Chart, and its critical reception has been generally positive.\n\nProduction and composition:\n\n\"Shiver\" was written two years before its release. Accordingly, Martin wrote the song while thinking of Australian singer-songwriter Natalie Imbruglia, the woman he was linked to, but later denied it. Some accounts have claimed, however, that Imbruglia was indeed not Martin's inspiration in writing the song. Instead, he appeared to have been inspired with girlfriends in his teenage days and early 20s. Martin actually wrote the song in a \"glum\" day, when he felt he would never find the right woman for him. He described it as something of a \"stalking song\", admitting he wrote it for a specific woman. In addition, Martin wrote the song while listening to music of Buckley, and had claimed it is their \"most blatant rip-off song\".\n\n\"Shiver\" was recorded in Rockfield Studios in Wales, United Kingdom, where the band was booked by A&R representative Dan Keeling to begin working on the band's debut album, Parachutes. Keeling was disappointed with the early demos presented to him, saying it \"didn't have any of their passion, their energy\", a result of the band's freshly resolved internal pressure in the time. Keeling deemed the demos as \"limp\" and asked the band to redo it. Smaller parts of the song were recorded at Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, England, where the band relocated after Christmas in 1999.\n\nThe song was produced by Coldplay and British record producer Ken Nelson. As with most songs in the album, Nelson used an analogue desk in recording \"Shiver\". The guitar was re-dubbed in search of perfection, while Martin de-tuned his guitar to easily generate complex chord sequences. Martin's vocals were recorded in more than one take, but the band chose the one with a single take.\n\n\"Shiver\" is in the alternative rock genre. A review claims that Coldplay's indie rock inclinations are obvious in the song. \"Shiver\" has been perceived to have influences of Buckley, whom Coldplay's early song influences were drawn from. Martin later said of the song that it was \"a blatant Jeff Buckley attempt, not quite as good, that's what I think\".\n\nRelease and reception\n\"Shiver\" is one of the older songs in Coldplay's catalogue, and had been performed at their early concerts in 1999. Later, it was initially released as an EP in the spring of 2000. It was released as the album's lead single in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2000, months before the release of the album. The single had been picked up for B-play lists on some European prominent radio stations. In the United States, it was released as the second single, following the hit single \"Yellow\".  Website IGN posted a video at the 2008 Games Convention in Leipzig, Germany, revealing \"Shiver\" to be part of the song list in the video game Guitar Hero World Tour.\n\nThe single's reception was generally positive. It reached number 35 on the UK Singles Chart. It also reached number 26 at the US Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks. The song remains, to this day, an audience favourite in live performances. It has earned the band praise from critics. Adrian Denning, in his review of the album, wrote, \"'Shiver' has a vocal that could be Jeff Buckley influenced, the soaring vocals are a joy over a reasonably guitar rock based instrumental track.\" A review by David DeVoe in Hybridmagazine.com reads, \"'Shiver' is a delightfully laid back tune, full of that great guitar sound that I have come to appreciate this band for.\" Spencer Owen of Pitchfork noted, \"It's the only truly decent song on Parachutes, but simultaneously, it's the only one that blatantly shows its influences. In fact, the influence can even be pinned to a single song: Jeff Buckley's 'Grace.'\"\n\nThe music video for \"Shiver\" was directed by English film director and cinematographer Grant Gee. It features Coldplay performing in a small studio. The yellow globe featured on the Parachutes cover can be seen on top of an amplifier in the video. The music video received \"strong exposure\" on MTV.\n\nIn 2003, \"Shiver\" was featured on Coldplay's live album Live 2003.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Coldplay released \"In My Place\" in the US and UK on 5 August 2002 as the album's lead single. The single was pressed with two B-sides: \"One I Love\" and \"I Bloom Blaum\". The single cover features Buckland, with art directed by S\u00f8lve Sundsb\u00f8.\n\n\"In My Place\" peaked at number two on UK Singles Chart on 17 August 2002, kept off the top by \"Colourblind\" by Darius Danesh. It stayed in the chart until 23 November 2002. The song reached number seventeen on Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 2002. The band were yet to have a number one single. In 2005, \"Speed of Sound\", the lead single of the band's third album, X&Y, also reached number two, but never the number one position. \"Speed of Sound\" was marked as Coldplay's most successful single until \"Viva la Vida\", reached number one in 2008.\n\n\"In My Place\" was written collaboratively by all the band members for their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head. The track is built around thumping drums and chiming guitars. It was released on 5 August 2002 as the lead single from A Rush of Blood to the Head and reached number two on the UK Singles Chart. The song also reached number 17 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks.\n\n\"In My Place\" was well received by critics, who complimented its arrangement and profound lyrics. The song won the award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nBackground and composition:\n\nIn an interview with Q magazine, lead singer Chris Martin stated that \"In My Place\" was a song Coldplay had left after recording their debut album Parachutes (2000).  When the band finished recording their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head, Martin said that the album was complete.  However, after guitarist Jonny Buckland played the song on his guitar, Martin said that they now needed to record it and include it on the album.  Martin also said that: \"That's about where you're put in the world, and how you're given your position, and the way you look, and how you have to get on with it.\" In an interview, Buckland revealed that the song was hard to record, as the band had played the song live. He also commented that when they started recording the song, they did not know how it should sound, due to the band members' contrasting ideas.\n\nThe song opens with a single crash cymbal followed by two bars of 4/4 drumming, then a plaintive three-note guitar line rings through a strummy rhythm, and Martin's vocals. Its instrumentation is varied with the sound of thumping drums, chiming guitars, a singalong chorus, and a string arrangement. The song also features a guitar lick swirl. The three lines of the third verse allude to a man's love of a woman, who does not reciprocate his love. He is saying he will always wait for her, but he does not think that she should stay where she is any longer. The lyrics emphasise: \"But I wait for you/if you go, if you go/leave me down here on my own/then I'll wait for you.\" The song's lyrics also include references to a desire for weary optimism.\n\nThe song is written in the key of A major.\n\nCritical reception:\n\nColdplay's performance of \"In My Place\" during the band's Viva la Vida Tour.\nCritics were positive towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly review of the album, critic David Browne wrote: \"Songs like 'In My Place' and 'Warning Sign' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes (''...You were an island / And I passed you by'' in the touching latter song) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle.\" Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: \"When the shimmering, pretty lead-off single 'In My Place' represents the album's weakest moment, you know you've got something extraordinary. Currently storming the charts a la 'Yellow', 'In My Place' is another surprisingly simple song, carried by Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar and Chris Martin\u2019s heartfelt vocals. It really shouldn't amount to much, but Coldplay make it work very well. When Martin sings, \"Please, please, please/Come back and sing to me,\" he totally sells it, and you buy it. And why not? The song's lovely.\n\nAmy M. Bruce of The Towerlight wrote: \"With a slew of introspective rock songs like 'In My Place' and 'God Put a Smile upon Your Face,' this album is worthy of the hype surrounding the band's first album.\" Jules Willis of the BBC wrote: \"The second track, the first written post-Parachutes and sounding like a refugee from that album, is the grower 'In My Place'. It's a fantastic pop tune that justifies Coldplay's status as one of UK's most exciting bands.\"\n\nA live recording of \"In My Place\" from Glastonbury Festival 2011 was released to download on 26 June 2011.\n\nMusic video:\nThe music video for \"In My Place\" was directed by Sophie Muller. It debuted on 17 June 2002 on AOL. It features a by-the-numbers band performance, in which Coldplay are playing in a huge, nearly empty room. The two women in the background were members of the video crew: a makeup artist/wardrobe assistant and the video commissioner. The video starts off with band playing; while they play, Chris Martin, who is sitting in a corner, gets up and joins them in the song. During the video, Martin sings directly to the camera. During the guitar solo, Martin runs up to the two women in the background, talks to them for a while, and then returns to sing the rest of the song. The video concludes with the band finishing the song.\n\nThe video was subjected to a spoof by Bad Lip Reading on their YouTube page. It was dubbed with the song \"Yeti\" that was composed and recorded, like BLR's other videos, to humorously reinterpret the lip movement and action in the video. \"Yeti\" has received over three million views on YouTube as of April 2017.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Coldplay released \"The Scientist\" in Europe on 4 November 2002 as the album's second single. The single was pressed with two B-sides: \"1.36\" and \"I Ran Away.\" While preparing for the song as the album's second release, the band's US label felt the song failed to \"provide enough of a blood rush for American listeners\"; instead, they released \"Clocks\" as the second single in the US. The song was released on 15 April 2003 in the US.\n\n\"The Scientist\" appeared on Australia Singles Chart at number 40 on 1 November 2003. It appeared on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks at number 18. The song peaked at number sixteen at Canada Singles Chart. The song peaked at number 10 in UK Top 75 on 17 November 2002.\n\nThe single's cover, created by S\u00f8lve Sundsb\u00f8, as with the album's other singles, features a band member, which in this case is drummer Will Champion.\n\n\"The Scientist\" was written collaboratively by all the band members for their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head. It is built around a piano ballad, with its lyrics telling the story about a man's desire to love and an apology. The song was released in the United Kingdom as the second single from A Rush of Blood to the Head and reached number 10 in the UK Charts. It was released in the United States as the third single and reached number 18 on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and number 34 on the Adult Top 40 chart.\n\nCritics were highly positive towards \"The Scientist\" and praised the song's piano ballad and falsetto. Several remixes of the track exist, and its riff has been widely sampled. The single's music video won three MTV Music Video Awards, for the video's use of reverse narrative. The song was also featured on the band's 2003 live album Live 2003 and has been a permanent fixture in the band's live set lists since 2002.\n\nBackground:\n\nLead singer Chris Martin wrote \"The Scientist\" after listening to George Harrison's All Things Must Pass. In an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, Martin revealed that while working on the band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, he knew that the album was missing something. One night, during a stay in Liverpool, Martin found an old piano that was out of tune. He wanted to work on Harrison's song, \"Isn't It a Pity\", but he could not manage to do so. When the song came to Martin, he asked that the recorder be turned on. He concluded by saying that he came across this chord sequence and noted that the chord was \"lovely\". Martin recorded the vocals and piano takes in a studio in Liverpool.\n\nWhen asked about the development of the song, during a track-by-track reveal, Martin said: \"That's just about girls. It's weird that whatever else is on your mind, whether it's the downfall of global economics or terrible environmental troubles, the thing that always gets you most is when you fancy someone.\" The liner notes from A Rush of Blood to the Head, on the other hand, states that \"The Scientist is Dan.\", with Dan referring to Dan Keeling, the A&R man who signed the band to Parlophone.\n\nComposition:\n\n\"The Scientist\" is a melancholic, piano-driven ballad written in the key of F major. The lyrics to the song allude to a man's powerlessness in the face of love. It begins with the main four-chord piano melody created by lead singer Chris Martin, transitioning to him singing the first verses. He is then joined by the rest of the band after the first chorus. In addition to the main piano melody, the music of the song is created by a string arrangement, harmony, acoustic guitar, with its rhythm being slow tempo drums and bass guitar riffs. Towards the end of the song, electric guitar riffs can be heard as lead guitarist Jonny Buckland switches from acoustic to lead guitar.\n\nReception:\n\n\"The Scientist\" received widespread critical acclaim. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone Magazine, in his review of the album, wrote: \"The fantastic piano ballad 'The Scientist' ...  a cataclysmic falsetto finale that could raise every hair on the back of your neck.\" Nick Southall of Stylus magazine wrote: \"The piano that chimes through 'The Scientist' is captured perfectly, the warm depression of each individual key caught rather than a shrill ringing as is so often the case.\" Ian Watson of NME wrote: \"'The Scientist' is a song inexorably linked with the endless night sky and the secret hopes and regrets of a hundred thousand strangers.\"\n\nIn October 2011, NME placed it at number 37 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\". In 2009, Rolling Stone ranked it number 54 on its \"100 Best Songs of the Decade\" list.\n\nOther versions:\n\nIn 2003, \"The Scientist\" was featured on Coldplay's live album Live 2003. The song was covered live by Aimee Mann and released on a special edition of her album Lost in Space. Natasha Bedingfield, Alex Band, Eamon, and Avril Lavigne covered the song on Jo Whiley's Live Lounge radio show. Also, Belinda Carlisle did a live rendition on the ITV1 reality show Hit Me Baby One More Time. The British female quartet All Angels did a choral arrangement of the song on their album Into Paradise which was released in 2007. The chords to this song are replicated by Sum 41 in their song \"Pieces.\" In addition, the American television show MADtv did a parody of the video, called \"The Narcissist.\" Coldplay's original version plus a cover of the track performed by Johnette Napolitano and Danny Lohner were featured in the 2004 film Wicker Park. Allison Iraheta and Kris Allen performed an acoustic duet of the song at Oprah Winfrey's \"No Phone Zone\" rally in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2011, Willie Nelson covered the song for a Chipotle Mexican Grill-sponsored short film titled Back to the Start, highlighting the problems of concentrated animal feeding operations. It also appears as the final track on his 2012 album Heroes. Nelson's version plays during the closing credits of the 2014 film The Judge. The song was used on 23 May 2011 episode of WWE Raw in a tribute video to wrestler \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage who had died three days earlier. The song was performed in the Glee episode \"The Break Up\" on 4 October 2012 by Cory Monteith, Darren Criss, Naya Rivera, Matthew Morrison, Lea Michele, Chris Colfer, Heather Morris and Jayma Mays. In 2014, Miley Cyrus covered the song at selected stops of her Bangerz Tour. Corinne Bailey Rae covered \"The Scientist\" for the soundtrack to the 2017 film Fifty Shades Darker. Conor Maynard covers a few verses of the song in his Acoustic rendition of Kris Kross Amsterdam & Conor Maynard - Are You Sure? ft. Ty Dolla $ign.\n\nMusic video:\n\nThe music video for \"The Scientist\" was notable for its distinctive reverse narrative, which employed reverse video. The same concept had been previously used for Spike Jonze's 1995 music video for The Pharcyde's \"Drop\". The reverse video style had first been seen in 1989 for the video for the song \"The Second Summer of Love\" by Scottish band Danny Wilson. In order for Martin to appear to be singing the lyrics in the reversed footage, he had to learn to sing the song backwards, which took him a month. The video was filmed at various locations, including London and at Bourne Woods in Surrey, before the first leg of the A Rush of Blood to the Head tour. It was directed by Jamie Thraves. The video was shot between 30 September \u2013 3 October 2002, premiering on 14 October.\n\nThe video opens, looking down on Martin who is singing, as he lies on his back on a mattress. As the camera shot pulls back, the mattress is revealed to be outside. A cyclist cycles past in reverse and Martin leaps up from the mattress. He walks in reverse through a city, out into the suburbs and eventually crossing a railway line and into woods, picking up his suit jacket as he goes. Upon arriving at his car, a black BMW, he gets in and briefly passes out. A woman, at first shown lying unresponsive on the ground in front of the car, is shown flying back in through the shattered windscreen. The car rolls back up a hill in the woods and through a broken fence, which joins back together as the car passes through it. As the video closes, the couple is shown driving back up the road. It is revealed that Martin's passenger had removed her seat belt, in order to put her jacket on, just before the car accident, causing her death. Irish actress Elaine Cassidy portrays the female passenger.\n\nIn 2003, \"The Scientist\" won multiple MTV Video Music Awards for Best Group Video, Best Direction, and Breakthrough Video. It was also nominated at the 2004 Grammy Awards for Best Short Form Music Video but lost to Johnny Cash's video for \"Hurt\". By February 2019 the video had received over 660 million views on YouTube.",

Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone Magazine, in his review of the album, wrote: \"The fantastic piano ballad 'The Scientist' ... [has] a cataclysmic falsetto finale that could raise every hair on the back of your neck.\" Nick Southall of Stylus magazine wrote: \"The piano that chimes through 'The Scientist' is captured perfectly, the warm depression of each individual key caught rather than a shrill ringing as is so often the case.\" Ian Watson of NME wrote: \"'The Scientist' is a song inexorably linked with the endless night sky and the secret hopes and regrets of a hundred thousand strangers.\"\n\nIn October 2011, NME placed it at number 37 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\". In 2009, Rolling Stone ranked it number 54 on its \"100 Best Songs of the Decade\" list.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Coldplay released \"Clocks\" in Europe on the 24th of March 2003 as the third single from their second studio album \"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\" The single was issued with two B-sides: \"Animals\", which was one of the band's favorite songs performed on tour but was not included in the album, and \"Crests of Waves\". \n\n  The single's cover created by S\u00f8lve Sundsb\u00f8, as with the album and its other singles, is a portrayal of one of the band members Chris Martin. \n\n Across the United States, while preparing \"The Scientist\" as the album's second release, Coldplay's US label felt the song failed to \"provide enough of a blood rush for American listeners\"; instead, they released \"Clocks\" as the second single in the US.\n\nGeneral Info:\n\n\"Clocks\" was written and composed, as a collaboration between all the members of the band, for their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head. Built around a piano riff, the song features cryptic lyrics concerning themes of contrast and urgency. Several remixes of the track exist and its riff has been widely sampled.\n\nThe record debuted to critical and commercial success, with critics mainly commenting on the song's piano melody, and winning the Grammy Award for Record of the Year. It was released in the United Kingdom as the third single from A Rush of Blood to the Head, where it reached number nine in the UK Singles Chart. It was released in the United States as the album's second single, it reached number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 9 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. Considered to be one of Coldplay's signature songs, \"Clocks\" continues to garner critical acclaim, and is often placed on lists ranking the greatest songs of the 2000s and of all time, including being ranked 490th on Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list in 2010.\n\nBackground and writing:\n\n\"Clocks\" was written and composed during the late stages of production of Coldplay's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head. A riff popped into Chris Martin's mind late one night in Liverpool when he came into the studio, where he then developed it on piano. According to Martin, \"Clocks\" was inspired by the English rock band Muse. Martin presented the riff to the band's guitarist, Jonny Buckland, who then added a layer of guitar chords to the basic track: \"He picked up his guitar  and played these brilliant chords ... It was like a chemical reaction process.\"\n\nBefore writing and composing \"Clocks\", the band had already written 10 songs for the album. However, because A Rush of Blood to the Head was nearing completion, they thought it was too late to include the new song on it. Hence, they recorded a demo and saved it with other unfinished tracks, labeling it \"Songs for #3\"; the band intended these tracks for what would be their third album.\n\nBy June 2002, Coldplay were ready to present the new album to their record label Parlophone. However, Martin felt it was \"rubbish\"; they were so far from being completely satisfied with the album that both the band and Parlophone delayed the release. After a headlining tour, Coldplay went on working \"Songs for #3\". Phil Harvey, the band's manager and a friend of Martin, heard it and pressed him to rework \"Clocks\" immediately. Harvey pointed out that, with its lyrics that speak of urgency, its meaning contradicted Martin's idea of stashing the track. Thus persuaded by Harvey, Martin then further developed \"Clocks\", while other band members supplemented his work with their ideas based on the main piano track, adding bass and drums. Coldplay recorded the song very quickly because the schedule of A Rush of Blood to the Head had already been delayed; the album was released two months later.\n\nComposition:\n\n\"Clocks\" is an alternative rock song, with elements of psychedelic rock. It features a repeating piano melody and a minimalist, atmospheric soundscape of synthesizer pads, drums, electric guitar, and bass guitar. Martin applied an ostinato, with emphasis that imitates a three against two poly-rhythm, as well as a descending scale on the piano chord progression, which switches from major to minor chords.\n\nThe themes of the lyrics include contrast, contradictions and urgency. According to Jon Wiederhon of MTV News, \"Martin seems to address the helplessness of being in a dysfunctional relationship he doesn't necessarily want to escape.\" The lyrics are cryptic; the ending lines of the second verse emphasis contradicting emotion: \"Come out upon my seas/Cursed missed opportunities/Am I a part of the cure/Or am I part of the disease?\" The song's title also \"metaphorically alludes\" to its lyrics, \"pushing one to wonder about the world's obsession with time while connecting it to the theory: make the best of it when we\u2019re here, present and alive.\"\n\nThe song is in the key of A\u266d major, with a main chord progression of E\u266d - B\u266dm - Fm.\n\nRelease and music video:\n\nA music video was filmed in support of the song. It was directed by British film-maker Dominic Leung, and shot at Docklands' ExCeL Building in London. It features the band performing the song, with a laser show, in front of a staged audience, mostly local college students. Stage effects and blue-red light transitions give the video a surreal feel, while a stoic crowd make up the audience.\n\nReception:\n\nColdplay performing \"Clocks\" on the Twisted Logic Tour\nThe song received acclaim from music critics. Rob Sheffield, in his review of the album for Rolling Stone magazine, said that \" Buckland shines in excellent psychedelic rockers such as ... 'Clocks.'\" David Cheal of The Daily Telegraph said that \"Clocks\" features a \"hypnotic piano riff, a pounding, almost frantic rhythm, and a contagious tune, all building to a gorgeously serene climax with Martin's floaty voice singing.\" Scott Floman, music critic for Goldmine magazine, described the song as \"a stunningly pretty piano rocker, absolutely perfect and is simply one of the finest songs of the decade.\"\n\n\"Clocks\" won the Record of the Year at the 2004 Grammy Awards. It was nominated for Best Single at the 2003 Q Awards. \"Clocks\" was ranked at number 68 on Pitchfork's Top 100 Singles of 2000-04. It was ranked at number 155 on Pitchfork Media's 500 Greatest Songs of the 2000s list. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 148 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\". In February 2013 the song was voted by listeners of BBC Radio 6 Music as the greatest song released during the 10 years the station had been broadcasting.\n\nThe single was successful in radio throughout 2003 and appeared on several singles charts worldwide. In the United Kingdom, the song peaked at number nine and in the United States rose to number 29. It also reached number seven in Canada and number 28 in Australia.\n\nLegacy:\n\n\"Clocks\" has been regarded as one of the finest achievements of Coldplay. The song's piano progression remains the band's signature creation. According to The New York Times, the opening piano arpeggios of \"Clocks\" have been widely sampled. Also, many of the songs in X&Y feature influences from \"Clocks\". Brian Cohen of Billboard magazine noted that \"Clocks\" served as a \"launching pad\" for songs featured in X&Y, \"several of which echo that track either in structure or feel.\" \"Speed of Sound\", the first single from Coldplay's third album, X&Y, is similar to \"Clocks\", in that the two songs have the same descending chord progression. According to The New York Times, American singer Jordin Sparks's 2008 single \"No Air\" \"breathes life into the overfamiliar piano line\" from \"Clocks\". The song \"Should I Go\" by American singer Brandy, from her album Afrodisiac, samples the piano riff of \"Clocks\", as does Mexican singer Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez's 2007 single \"Te Voy A Perder\". In 2009, French DJ David Guetta in collaboration with Kelly Rowland released the song \"When Love Takes Over\", which has a piano introduction like that of \"Clocks\". A riff similar to \"Clocks\" was also used for the 2009 song \"Shining Down\" by Chicagoan hip hop artist Lupe Fiasco and featuring Matthew Santos. An analogous riff can also be heard in the DJ Cahill Remix of the Agnes song I Need You Now. Rolling Stone ranked \"Clocks\" No. 490 of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2010.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Coldplay released \"God Put a Smile upon Your Face\" in the UK on the 7th of July 2003. This was followed with releases in the US and Canada on the 14th of July 2003. The song was later released on the 21st of July 2003 in Australia and Taiwan.  \n   \nWhen the song was released, it featured the B-side \"Murder\". The single cover features bassist Guy Berryman, art-directed by S\u00f8lve Sundsb\u00f8.  Regional singles were released for Canada, Europe, Australia, and an enhanced version for Taiwan. Promotional singles were released in the UK and US. Since only promo copies were released, the single reached only number 100 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nGeneral Info:\n\n\"God Put a Smile upon Your Face\" was written by all members of the band for their second studio album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002). The song is built around prominent acoustic and electric guitar riffs with accompanying up-tempo drumming. The song was released on 14 July 2003 as the fourth and final single from the album.\n\nRegional singles were released for Canada, Europe, Australia, and an enhanced version for Taiwan. Promo singles were released for the United Kingdom and United States. Since only promo copies were released, the single reached only number 100 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nBackground:\n\nColdplay vocalist Chris Martin said, about the writing of the song, \"That came out of playing live and wanting to have something with a bit more bounce. We were really getting into things like PJ Harvey and Muse \u2013 things with a bit more energy.\"\n\nWhen asked about the development of the song, during a track-by-track reveal, bassist Guy Berryman said:\n\nWhen we came to record it in the studio we struggled because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was and so it was a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favorite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favorite tracks.\n\nComposition:\n\nThe song features an acoustic and electric guitar sound. The song starts with a hushed acoustic ballad before building into a roar of an electric guitar and soaring with vocals. The song also includes an uptempo metronomic drumming rhythm.\n\nThe first line of the third verse allude to a definitive moment with the cryptic reference to God: \"Now when you work it out, I'm worse than you/Yeah, when you work it out I wanted to/Now, when you work out where to draw the line/Your guess is as good as mine.\" Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that the lyric \"God gave you style and gave you grace,\" Martin sings as if \"cataloging the attributes he only wishes he had\". When the song is performed live, guitarist Jonny Buckland begins a long ripping off guitar riff while Chris Martin plays an acoustic guitar.\n\nReception:\n\nCritics were positive towards the song. In the Rolling Stone review of the album, critic Rob Sheffield wrote: \"'God Put a Smile Upon Your Face' is the slinkiest and best thing Coldplay have ever done.\" Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: \"Buckland's lead fills highlight the wondrous 'God Put a Smile on Your Face', as the song's chorus reaches heights that rival those of their fellow countrymen Doves.\" Ted Kessler of NME wrote: \"Over a pounding garage tattoo Martin poses a deep, mortality-based teaser ('where do we go from here?'), asserts some self-belief ('God gave me style, God gave me grace') and then hits upon the bottom line as the song's mood suddenly improves with another fat and glorious chorus: 'Yeah, when you work it out I'm the same as you....your guess is as good as mine.'\"\n\n\"God Put a Smile upon Your Face\" was featured in the band's live album, Live 2003. The song is available on Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock video game as a downloadable song. The game also includes other Coldplay songs such as \"Yellow\" and \"Violet Hill\". Plan B sampled the track on his 2007 mixtape Paint it Blacker. The song was also covered by Mark Ronson on his album Version, which he performed live with Adele at the 2008 Brit Awards.\n\nThe song was also covered by Matt Jorgensen +451 on their album Hope release on Origin Records.\n\nMusic video:\n\nThe music video, released in October 2003, is shot in black-and-white and has a narrative theme. The video is directed by Jamie Thraves, who had previously directed the band's third video for \"The Scientist\".\n\nThe video inter-cuts footage of the band performing the song with the story of a businessman, who is humiliated and horrified to find that he is gradually disappearing, after bumping into a mysterious stranger with no shoes. The businessman is played by actor Paddy Considine.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Coldplay released \u201cSpeed of Sound\u201d in the UK and US on the 18th of April 2005 as the album\u2019s lead single. The single was pressed with two B-sides: \u201cThings I Don\u2019t Understand\u201d and \u201cProof\u201d.\n\nGeneral Info:\n\n\"Speed of Sound\" was written by all members of the band for their third studio album, X&Y (2005). Constructed around a piano and guitar riff, the song builds into a huge, synthesizer-heavy chorus. It was released by Parlophone Records as the lead single from the album. \"Speed of Sound\" was released in the US and UK on 18 April 2005, and then made its radio premiere on BBC Radio 1 with Lamacq on the day of the release on 19 April. The single was pressed with two B-sides: \"Things I Don't Understand\" and \"Proof\". The song premiered in the UK on 23 May.\n\nColdplay vocalist Chris Martin admitted that the song was developed after the band had listened to English art rock singer Kate Bush. Upon the song's release, it charted in the UK Singles Chart in the number two position. In the United States, it debuted at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100, their first top ten hit in the country, and their most successful song until \"Viva la Vida\" reached number one in 2008.\n\n\"Speed of Sound\" was recognized Song of the Year by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and it was nominated twice at the 48th Grammy Awards. The song won a Brit Award in the category for Best British Single in 2006. The track's music video was nominated for four MTV Video Music Awards. \"Speed of Sound\" was also the billionth song downloaded from the iTunes Store.\n\nBackground:\n\nIn an interview, Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin revealed that the song was written in mid-2004 and was inspired by Martin's daughter, Apple, and English alternative rock singer Kate Bush: \"That's a song where we were listening to a lot of Kate Bush last summer, and we wanted a song which had a lot of tom-toms in it. I just had my daughter up also, and was kind of feeling in a sense of awe and wonderment, so the song is kind of a Kate Bush song about miracles.\" The drumbeat of the song was inspired by Bush's 1985 song \"Running Up that Hill\". In a separate interview, bassist Guy Berryman said: \"We were really trying to recreate the drums on that song for this song, and the chords. Some bands are reluctant to admit that they take things from other artists and bands that they listen to and we're shameless in that respect, we don't mind telling.\"\n\nThe band's opinion towards the song, however, has soured. Martin has said that he dislikes \"Speed of Sound\", saying in a 2011 interview, \"We never got it right.\" During an interview with Howard Stern, Martin said that his dislike of \"Speed of Sound\" stems from the song having \"a shit recording.\" Due to this, Martin is reluctant to perform the song live, citing his feelings towards the song, noting that \"an audience can pick up real fast if you\u2019re not convinced by something.\"\n\nComposition:\n\n\"Speed of Sound\" is a piano-based song with an upbeat tempo. The song begins with the insistently ornate keyboard melody, with a backing synthesizer that is heard throughout the song. The melody then transitions into the first verse being sung by lead singer Chris Martin. It repeats, with the song then transitioning into its second verse. The verses of song feature the rest of the band as the song continues to build. It then climaxes with the anthemic chorus, which features a huge roar of instrumentation that includes electric & bass guitars, drums, and synthesizers. The song then ends with the chorus and its grandiose sound. \"Speed of Sound\" is written in the key A Mixolydian.\n\nThe lyrics in the song are cryptic; The ending lines of the third verse emphasize belief and assurance: \"If you could see it then you'd understand/ah, when you see it then you'll understand,\" and \"Some things you have to believe/others are puzzles puzzling me.\" The fourth line in the second verse alludes to discovering your place in the world: \"How long am I gonna stand/with my head stuck under the sand.\"\n\nIn his review of X&Y, Bill White of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer newspaper noted that the \"slowing ... creative juices\" evident in \"Speed of Sound\" compare to \"melodies from both Jeff Buckley ('Last Goodbye') and Keane ('Everybody's Changing')\".\n\nRelease and Critical reception\n\nThe song was met with a polarized response from critics. PopMatters felt that the song \"comes close to sounding too safe, almost like the band is on autopilot.\" Several critics felt that the song resembled Coldplay's earlier single \"Clocks\". MusicOMH commented that \"Speed Of Sound, the lead single, has 'Clocks'-like drumming contrasts with synth sequences that remind more of Enya than rock music\" and criticized it for sounding \"familiar and far older than it is.\" Pitchfork Media likewise criticized the song's \"uncanny resemblance to 'Clocks'\" and continued \"Certainly, it rarely hurts to stick with what works, but this is not just a near-exact replica of its successful predecessor; it's also a less memorable song riding a piano hook that has so deeply infiltrated the pop-culture landscape that I've become numb to it.\" The reviewer did, however, comment that \"the track's vocal melody outperforms the one from 'Clocks' by a hair.\"\n\nThe Village Voice felt that the song was \"unusually accomplished, fresh, and emotional.\" Paste Magazine praised the song, saying that it \"reveals the hand  playing: a piano riff as memorable as the one in 'Clocks,' ringing guitars, martial drums, orchestral pomp and, in the center, Chris Martin's keening vocal, so vulnerable and yet forceful enough to stand out from the mass of sonic detail.\" The New York Times, contrariwise, dinged X&Y for \"trying to carry beauty of 'Clocks' across an entire album \u2013 not least in its first single, 'Speed of Sound,' which isn't the only song on the album to borrow the 'Clocks' drumbeat.\" Rolling Stone magazine gave a mixed review, calling it \"an appealing but not thrilling song\" and noted \"...it sounds a bit like...\"Clocks\" but without the swagger.\"\n\nChart performance:\n\n\"Speed of Sound\" was beaten to the number one spot on the UK Singles Chart by the novelty song \"Axel F\" by the Crazy Frog, instead peaking at number two for a week, although it did stay in the Top 75 for sixteen non-consecutive weeks. However, it became Coldplay's first UK download number one.\n\nIt also became Coldplay's first and (at that point) biggest single to chart in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, debuting as well as peaking at number eight, making it the band's most successful single until \"Viva la Vida\" reached number one in 2008. The single marked the first time a British band entered directly in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart since \"Say You'll Be There\" by the Spice Girls. The song was also the billionth song downloaded from Apple, Inc.'s iTunes Store. A ringtone was available from Cingular Wireless, which had a song clip from \"Speed of Sound\" available a week before it was heard on radio. The song was also included in \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's polka medley \"Polkarama!\" from his 2006 album Straight Outta Lynwood.\n\nAccolades:\n\n\"Speed of Sound\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards in the categories of Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance By a Duo or Group With Vocals at the 2006 Grammy Awards. The song won an MTV Europe Music Award in the category for Best Song. In December 2005, \"Speed of Sound\" appeared at number nine on Q magazine's \"100 Greatest Tracks of the Year\". In 2006, the song won a Brit Award for Best British Single. That same year, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) named the track Song of the Year.\n\nMusic video:\n\nThe music video has a two-story-high LED display in the background\nThe video promo for \"Speed of Sound\" was shot on a Los Angeles sound stage on 22 and 23 April 2005. Shooting took place on large sets backed by large Light-emitting diode (LED) displays developed by Element Labs. The performance-based video was directed by Mark Romanek. The video features the band performing in front of a curved ellipse wall that consists of 640 Element Labs' VersaTubes placed on 6-inch (150 mm) centres.\n\nThe on-set animations were programmed and performed live during the shoot. Romanek wanted the song's stem \"split out\" and to have the drums, bass, guitar, and vocals on separate tracks, which were then animated, and the lights were synthesised to each of the tracks. In the end, Romanek and Michael Keeling, the lighting designer, opted to use Chris Martin's vocal track to animate \"because it had such dynamics. Roughly 75% of the video is driven by voice-activated animation\", said Keeling.\n\nThe video opens in pitch-black, followed by a light framing Martin as he reaches skyward out of the shadows. The scene then shifts to the band, as they play the song. When Martin spread his hands, the two-story-high LED lights erupt in a color of rainbow hues. The LED background changes colors as the band continues. The video concludes its ending with the band lined up, one-by-one, and the LED set displaying a white light background.\n\nThe video debuted on 23 May 2005 and proved successful on video-chart programs. It debuted on 11 June 2005 on Fuse's No. 1 Countdown Rock, at number six, and retired on 5 August at number seven of the countdown. It also reached number sixteen in MuchMusic's Countdown a month after its debut. At the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, the video garnered nominations in the categories of Video of the Year, Best Special Effects, Best Editing, and Best Cinematography. The video was the ranked at number 10 on VH1's Top 40 of 2005.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Coldplay released \"Fix You\" in the UK and US on the 5th of September 2005 as the second single of their third album. The single was pressed with two B-sides: \"The World Turned Upside Down\" and \"Pour Me\". On the 14th of September 2005, the band released the Fix You EP in the iTunes Store. In response to Hurricane Katrina, all of the sales went to the American Red Cross Hurricane 2005 Relief and the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences' MusiCares Hurricane Relief Fund. Promotional singles were released in the UK and US.\n\nGeneral Info:\n\n\"Fix You\"was written by all four members of the band for their third studio album, X&Y (2005). The track is built around an organ accompanied by piano and guitar in the first half and an alternative rock style in the second half featuring electric guitar, bass and drums.\n\nIt was released on 5 September 2005 as the second single from X&Y and has reached number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. The song reached number 18 in the United States Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Promo singles were released for the UK and US. Blythe Danner, the mother of Gwyneth Paltrow and former mother-in-law of Chris Martin, stated in an interview in May 2012 that Martin 'wrote the song for Gwyneth when her father died and I weep every time I hear it'.\n\n\"Fix You\" was critically acclaimed by music critics. It has been widely sampled, with different covers and sounds. The music video was garnered as a tribute to the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The guitar solo of \"Fix You\" is currently used as the player introduction at all of the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens' home games, during the three stars of the game selection after every Los Angeles Kings home win, and was played at Staples Center as the Stanley Cup was brought on the ice after the Kings' victory in the 2014 Stanley Cup Final. The song is also used for the 2015\u201316 New York Islanders inaugural season in Barclays Center.\n\nThe song was played live at the Steve Jobs memorial/celebration-of-life event at Apple headquarters on 19 October 2011 in Cupertino, California and at One Love Manchester charity concert on 4 June 2017.\n\nBackground:\n\nWhen writing the song, lead singer Martin originally intended to use a church-style organ for the track. Unable to gain access to the instrument, Martin instead used an old keyboard that his late father-in-law, Bruce Paltrow, gave to his daughter Gwyneth. However, in other instances Martin has claimed that \"Fix You\" is influenced by English alternative rock band Elbow's 2003 anthem \"Grace Under Pressure\".\n\nWhen asked about the development of the song, Martin said: \"My father-in-law Bruce Paltrow bought this big keyboard just before he died. No one had ever plugged it in. I plugged it in, and there was this incredible sound I'd never heard before. All these songs poured out from this one sound. Something has to inspire you, and something else takes over. It's very cloudy.\" Martin also noted that the song is \"probably the most important song we've ever written\".\n\nDuring a track-by-track analysis bassist Guy Berryman admitted that the song takes \"a bit of inspiration\" from Jimmy Cliff's 1969 song \"Many Rivers to Cross\". Berryman also added, \"It becomes its own thing, kind of like points of inspiration that kind of lead you down certain paths. Whenever you want to write a song like someone else, it ultimately ends up sounding like something different anyway.\"\n\nComposition:\n\nThe song, which is written in the key of E\u266d major, features an organ and piano sound. The song starts with a hushed electric organ ballad, including Martin's falsetto. The song then builds with acoustic guitar and piano, along with a string section during the beginning choruses. The sound then shifts with a plaintive three-note guitar line, ringing through a rhythmic upbeat drum tempo. The song then transitions to its bridge, which roars into an instrumentation of piano notes, electric & bass guitar riffs, drums, and a singalong chorus with an anthemic feel. A synthesizer then joins the instrumentation, during the second half of the bridge. The song finally ends with the beginning chorus, with slow, melancholic piano notes being played in the background.\n\nThe message throughout the song, in which Martin sings, is words of encouragement: \"Lights will guide you home / And ignite your bones / And I will try to fix you.\" Michele Hatty of USA Weekend reported that Martin sings about recovering from grief in the song. Travis Gass of the Bangor Daily News wrote that Martin offers his sympathies for the downtrodden, with \"When you love someone but it goes to waste / Could it be worse?\".\n\nRelease:\n\nThe track peaked at number four in the UK Singles Chart on 17 September 2005. As of 30 July 2011, the song had spent 122 weeks on that chart.  It peaked at number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 18 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks. The song also charted on the Billboard Pop 100 and Hot Digital Songs. The single appeared in Australia's Singles Chart in the number four position on 18 September 2005, after retiring in the 58 spot. It also appeared at number eight on the Irish Singles Chart and spent seven consecutive weeks on the chart. On 14 November 2010, the song re-entered the Australian singles chart at number 37.\n\nIn 2005, Coldplay performed the song live on Saturday Night Live and the Live 8 event in July. It has also become the anthem for the event.\n\nIn 2009, the song also appeared on Coldplay's live album, LeftRightLeftRightLeft.\n\nOn 19 October 2011, the band played the song at the \"Celebrating Steve\" event for Apple employees over a global media stream to all the Apple Stores. This event was also available for Apple customers via the company website. On 4 June 2017, Coldplay performed \"Fix You\" at the One Love Manchester benefit concert for the victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.\n\nReception:\n\nThe song received widespread acclaim from music critics. In the Rolling Stone Magazine review of the album, critic Kelefa Sanneh wrote: \"One of the best is 'Fix You', an unabashedly sentimental song where Martin delivers words of encouragement in a gentle falsetto  Proving once more that no band can deliver a stately rock ballad like this one.\" Paul McNamee of NME magazine wrote: \"It\u2019s a wonderful song that shifts from simple stark piano and voice to a ringing, clattering burst of intent and proto-prog four-part harmony.\" Adrien Begrand of PopMatters in his review of the album, noted the song as the \"best ballad\" off X&Y. In 2005, the song appeared at number two on Q magazine's \"100 Greatest Tracks of the Year\", and was listed as one of the \"Tracks of the Year\" by NME in 2005.\n\nMusic video:\n\nThe music video for \"Fix You\" was directed by Sophie Muller, who had previously worked with the band for their 2002 video \"In My Place\". The video was filmed at the end of two concerts on 4 and 5 July 2005 at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, England, which were the band's first ever stadium performances. The concert goers doubled as extras for the video shoot, which required two takes on each day to complete.\n\nIn the first half of the video, Martin, wanders the streets of London starting at Tooley Street under London Bridge station, while the slogan \"Make Trade Fair\" is projected onto the Royal National Theatre, using the same ITA2 colour scheme on the cover of X&Y. The tunnels that Martin is seen wandering within are located both in and around King's Cross and St Pancras railway stations, with the filming for the video taking place during the time of the redevelopment and expansion of the latter. Martin is then seen walking across Waterloo Bridge, which crosses the River Thames, connecting the South Bank with The Strand. As soon as the electric guitar kicks in, Martin's walk turns into a run as he darts through streets of London, until very quickly reaching the side of the stage at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, where he joins the rest of the band for the song's finale. The audience sings along with the song's final refrain, and at the end of the video Martin thanks them for their support and wishes them goodnight.\n\nThe video debuted on 1 August 2005. It was nominated at the 15th annual Music Video Production Association Awards in the category of Adult Contemporary. After its release, the music video was re-purposed as a tribute to the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, although it was filmed before they occurred.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Coldplay released \"Talk\" in the UK and US on the 19th of December 2005 as the album's third single. The single was pressed with two B-sides: \"Gravity\" and \"Sleeping Sun\".\n\n\"Talk\" is a song built around a motif from Kraftwerk's 1981 song \"Computer Love\", it was written by all members of the band and appeared on their third album, X&Y. In the United States, the song entered at number 86 on the Billboard Hot 100 and elsewhere in the world its success varied. It peaked at number one in the Netherlands' Dutch Top 40, becoming the band's first number one single there.\n\nThe song received positive reviews, with critics noting the music's sound and memorable lyrics. Both the song and its \"Thin White Duke\" remix were nominated for the 2007 Grammy Awards, the latter of which won in the category of Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical.\n\nBackground:\n\nColdplay had difficulties with the recording sessions for months, as to the sound of the track. They were sceptical in deciding to add \"Talk\" to the final track listing of X&Y. During the recording sessions, which had seen the band scrap huge amounts of material, the song was left out when they sent early versions of the album to its record label, Parlophone. The song, however, made it to the track list, after it was properly mixed.\n\nWhen asked about the development of the song by NME.com, vocalist Chris Martin said, \"From that version,  we went and did a whole other version of it. A whole other song. What happened with the song 'Talk' is that it was all going great and then someone said 'That should be the first single' and we all just freaked out and scrapped it all.  We\u2019ve just mixed it and it sounds great. I think we\u2019ve had such pain getting to that place, I\u2019m not sure anyone quite knows what to do with it anymore. When we heard it mixed properly, it sounded mega.\"\n\nThe band received permission from the electronic music German band Kraftwerk to use the main riff from its song \"Computer Love\", from its 1981 studio album Computer World, for \"Talk\", replacing Kraftwerk's synthesizers with guitars. In a track-by-track interview given by the band on X&Y, bassist Guy Berryman reported that in response to the band's request, Kraftwerk founding member Ralf H\u00fctter \"said something like, 'Yes, you can use it, and thank you very much for asking my permission, unlike that bastard Jay-Z'.\" Martin also recalled in a 2007 article in Q magazine the process of requesting permission to use the melody: He sent a letter through the lawyers of the respective parties and several weeks later received an envelope containing a handwritten reply that simply said \u2033yes\u2033.\n\nThe band recorded three separate versions of the single; the one recorded on X&Y was based on an early cut of the song. An early version of the track \u2013 with a different set of lyrics \u2013 was leaked onto the internet in early 2005. The track was originally intended to be a B-side for the song \"Speed of Sound\", before becoming the last addition to X&Y's track listing.\n\nComposition:\n\nThe track begins with a dark, desolate synthesizer beat, resembling 'howling wind', with electric guitar riffs being heard in the background. This slow introduction sets the course for the song's hypnotic pace, with Will Champion adding a metronomic beat to the drums throughout the song. As previously noted, the song features the main hook from Kraftwerk's \"Computer Love\", replicated by Jonny Buckland's electric guitar riffs throughout much of the track. Buckland also uses the hook as a chiming note for more abrasive riffs during the bridge (or breakdown) near the end of the song. A string section can be heard during the choruses and before the start of the bridge. Guy Berryman also plays uptempo bass lines to compliment the track's pace, featuring slower, more abrasive riffs during the song's verses and bridge.\n\nIn the fourth line of the second verse, Martin sings: \"Or write a song nobody had sung/Or do something that's never been done.\" The third line of the third verse is: \"Tell me how do you feel?/Well I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak/And they're Coldplay perfortalking it to me.\" In the fifth verse, Martin summarizes about an individual who is lost and trying to discover the unknown: \"So you don't know where you're going/But you want to talk/And you feel like you're going where you've been before/You'll tell anyone who will listen but you feel ignored.\"\n\nAccording to Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine, the meaning to \"Talk\" is based on how Martin \"wants to teach us how to feel better about ourselves, and his lessons have the moral superiority disguised as sensitivity that marked Bono's mighty mullet period.\" Tyrangiel interpreted the lyrics, \"Are you lost or incomplete/ Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece/ Tell me how you feel\", with Martin begging in the song.\n\nRelease:\n\n\"Talk\" peaked at number 10 in the UK Singles Chart on 31 December 2005. The song charted at number 86 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number five on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 2005. The song was released early in the Netherlands, thus charting in the Dutch Top 40. It reached number one the closing week of 2005. The band performed the song live at the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards in Lisbon, Portugal, the 2006 Juno Awards in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the 2006 Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, California.\n\nReception:\n\nCritics were positive towards the song. In the PopMatters review of the album, critic Adrian Begrand wrote: \"It's the excellent, and much talked-about 'Talk' that has the band showing tremendous creativity, delving straight into mid-'70s krautrock, and piecing together a gorgeous pop song.\" Bud Scoppa of Paste magazine wrote: \"'Talk' stands out as an anthem in an album full of them.\" Dan Tallis of the BBC noted that the track was \"fantastic\" and \"positively gargantuan\". Jonathan Keefe of Slant magazine wrote: \"'Talk' is given one of the album's most memorable melodies, but its impact is reduced by the song's structure, in which the lead guitar echoes Martin's vocal melody after every line, so that melody becomes tiresome well before the first chorus hits.\" Despite the positive reception of \"Talk\", Martin has stated that Berryman dislikes it, and thus they no longer perform the song live.\n\nThe song was remixed by Jacques Lu Cont, with the title \"Talk (Thin White Duke Mix)\". The song by Lu Cont won the coveted Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical award at the 2007 Grammy Awards. \"Talk\" was also nominated for a Grammy award in the category of Best Rock Performance by a duo or Group with Vocals.\n\nThe song was also used as the basis of a downloadable hoax track titled \"Talk to David\" produced as an April Fools' Day prank by the British newspaper The Guardian. This featured lyrics purporting to give support to Conservative opposition party leader David Cameron.\n\nThe song was featured heavily in the season two CSI: NY episode \"Jamalot\", in which the character Danny Messer plays the song as a ringtone on his cell phone. The band's American record label, Capitol Records, paid for promotional consideration to place the song in the episode and for the character to talk about Coldplay.\n\nMusic video:\n\nThe music video for \"Talk\" was helmed by director/photographer Anton Corbijn. Filming of the video took place on 5 and 6 November 2005 at Ealing Studios, London, England.  The black-and-white clip invokes a B movie science fiction theme, with imagery ranging from a flying saucer to 3D glasses. The main plot line of the music video features the band as astronauts landing on an alien planet, where they re-activate a dormant robot, who eventually eats them and their spaceship as they are attempting to fly away.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Coldplay released \"The Hardest Part\" in the US and UK on the 3rd of April 2006 as the fourth single of their third album. The single was pressed with a B-side, \"How You See the World\", recorded live at Earls Court. The international version of the single was made available in the UK on 19 June 2006. Regional singles were released for Canada, Europe, Australia, and a different version for Taiwan. Promotional singles were released in the UK and US.\n\nGeneral Info:\n\n\"The Hardest Part\" was written by all four members of the band for their third album, X&Y. A piano-based ballad song, it begins with a piano melody, followed with electric guitar lines, that accompanies slow-tempo drumming. It was released on 3 April 2006 as the fourth single from X&Y. The song was released as a radio-only song on United Kingdom radio stations. It appeared on the United States Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and peaked at number 37, making it Coldplay's first appearance on that chart and helping establish moderate success at AC radio for future singles like \"Viva la Vida\", \"Paradise\", and \"Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall\". \"The Hardest Part\" also charted in Australia, Italy and New Zealand.\n\nThe song was well received by critics. The track was complimented for its musical style. Regional singles were released in Canada, Europe, and Australia; a different version was released in Taiwan. Promo singles were released for the UK and US. The international version of the single was made available in the UK on 19 June 2006.\n\nProduction and composition:\n\nThe previous single from X&Y, \"Talk\", was a tribute to the German band Kraftwerk; similarly, \"The Hardest Part\" was intended by Coldplay to acknowledge American band R.E.M. When asked why the song paid a tribute to R.E.M.'s lead singer, Michael Stipe, Chris Martin said: \"I've lost all respect for fame, but I haven't lost all respect for respect. So the one great thing about being famous is that I get to meet people who I respect. Our relationship is akin to a dog and its master. I'll always look up to him.\" The band felt the track resembled R.E.M.'s 1991 single, \"Losing My Religion\". \"The Hardest Part\" was left out of the album track list when the band sent an early version of X&Y to their record label, Parlophone, but was included when the album was finalized.\n\nRelease and reception:\n\nThe track peaked at number 37 on Billboard's Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. Although the song did not chart on the UK Singles Chart, as the song was released as a radio-only song, the single peaked on the Italian charts on 11 May 2006 at number 19 and spent a week in the chart. Afterward, the song peaked on the New Zealand Singles Chart at number 34 on 21 August 2006. A live piano version of \"The Hardest Part\" appeared on Coldplay's 2009 live album LeftRightLeftRightLeft.\n\nCritics were positive towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly review of the album, music contributor David Browne wrote that the song \"is imbued with the sense of regret and letting go that we've heard from the band before, but with added musical muscle.\" Michael Hubbard of MusicOMH wrote: \"'A Message' and 'The Hardest Part' sound like companion pieces, both big songs.\" Critic Kelefa Sanneh of Rolling Stone noted that the song gets \"less catchy as it goes along\". Adrien Begrand from PopMatters wrote that \"The Hardest Part\" is a \"pleasant slice of R.E.M. style pop.\" Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun reported that the song sounded \"like the Smiths meets REM.\" David Cheal of The Daily Telegraph noted, \"...'The Hardest Part' is lovely, straightforward, instantly accessible pop-rock\".\n\nMusic video:\n\nThe music video for \"The Hardest Part\" was shot on 3 March 2006 in St. Petersburg, Florida. The video uses footage from the television series Attitudes, a series aired on the Lifetime television network, from 1985\u20131991. The video is digitally enhanced to appear as though Coldplay is performing the music alongside the act appearing on stage. American actress Linda Dano, who played Felicia Gallant on the US soap opera Another World, is also featured. The dancers on the stage are 84-year-old Barbara Moseley and 25-year-old Gene Spencer, whose performance was actually filmed in 1990. The music video was directed by Mary Wigmore.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Everyday Life is the eighth studio album by Coldplay, released on 22 November 2019. It is a double album, with the first half titled Sunrise and the other Sunset.\n\nPromotion\nOn 13 October 2019, black-and-white posters featuring the band teasing the album, and the date \"22 November 1919\" appeared in various cities around the world, including S\u00e3o Paulo, Berlin, Hong Kong and Sydney. On 19 October, a video teaser featuring the same theme was also released. Two days later, several fans began receiving typewritten notes from the band in the mail.\n\n\u201c\tdear friends / my typing isn't very good i'm sorry / I and we hope wherever you are you're ok / for the last 100 years or thereabouts we have been working on a thing called Everyday Life / in the classifieds you might write 'double album for sale, one very careful owner' / one half is called 'sunrise', the other 'sunset' / it comes out 22 november / it is sort of how we feel about things / we send much love to you from hibernation /\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0648 \u062d\u0628 / chris, jonny, guy and Will Champion, esq.\t\u201d\n\u2014\u200aColdplay, in a typewritten note to their fans\nOn 23 October, the track listing was announced by the band in the advertising sections of several newspapers around the world.

      "strReview": "\u201cEvery day is great and every day is terrible,\u201d said Chris Martin in a recent interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of trouble, but there\u2019s also so much positivity\u201d. The statement was a departure from the Coldplay frontman\u2019s recently optimistic view of the world; the kind of \u2018posi-vibes\u2019 electronic pop that characterised much of his band\u2019s last album, 2015\u2019s \u2018A Head Full Of Dreams\u2019. In 2019, Martin has acknowledged that the world isn\u2019t always, ahem, \u201cyellow\u201d. It can, in fact, be quite shit.\n\nStep forward Coldplay\u2019s eighth record: a double-album comprised of \u2018Sunrise\u2019 (part one) and \u2018Sunset\u2019 (part two), which veers frequently between the topical and timeless highs and lows of love, war, racism, faith, gun control, friendship, climate change and police brutality. It\u2019s an unflinching contemplation on the state of the world, armed with some of the band\u2019s most experimental and uncharacteristic music since 2008\u2019s \u2018Viva La Vida\u2019.\n\nOpener \u2018Sunrise\u2019 sets the tone beautifully with a major/minor string arrangement that could be from a war film soundtrack \u2013 not the work of one of the planet\u2019s biggest bands. The lead violin plays an at once mournful and hopeful timbre: a perfect representation of Martin\u2019s note on the duality of good and bad.\n\nWhat follows is the album\u2019s best track. \u2018Church\u2019 is Coldplay 101: a moving, ambient, transcendental piece of pop music. As Martin digs into his usual adventurist metaphors (\u201cWhen you\u2019re setting your sail / Oh can I be your seventh sea\u201d) his crystalline falsetto is met with swells of strings, cascading guitar arpeggios and avian trip-hop breakbeats. Norah Shaqur, meanwhile, makes for a stunning guest spot singing in Arabic verse. \u201cI worship in your church, baby, always,\u201d may signal the particular spiritual sanctuary afforded to Martin by his lover, but the meeting of Eastern and Western sounds alludes to a globalised acceptance of different religions.\n\nThat broad church perspective becomes a common thread of \u2018Everyday Life\u2019. The religious opinions of his bandmates Jonny Buckland (guitar), Guy Berryman (bass) and Will Champion (drums) remain unknown, but it\u2019s worth noting that Martin has spoken openly about omnism (treating all religions as equal). And he doesn\u2019t hide from it in \u2018Everyday Life\u2019. On the hushed, acoustic folk song \u2018WOTW/POTP\u2019 he sings of \u201ca world gone wrong\u201d, where he \u201cshall be strong / [\u2026] My faith is strong\u201d.\n\nElsewhere, on \u2018BrokEn\u2019, the band enlists a gospel choir for a stripped-back, finger-clicking piano number (\u201cOh the Lord will shine a light on me\u201d). \u2018When I Need A Friend\u2019 plays out like a modern hymn, with the London Voices Choir accompanying Martin\u2019s sombre chants of \u201cHoly, Holy / Dark defend / Shield and should me\u201d.\n\nLater, on Sunset\u2019s \u2018Cry Cry Cry\u2019 Martin references Jizo Bodhisattva, an enlightened being revered primarily in east Asian Buddhism. This loungey rhythm and blues number, which interpolates Garnet Mimms and the Enchanters\u2019 1963 hit \u2018Cry Baby\u2019, is one of the few religious-tinged tracks that has actually has something musically interesting about it. At first, Martin\u2019s pitch-shifted chipmunk wails, partnered with his own raw vocals, appear gratuitous. Somehow, they morph into a catchy doo-wop accompaniment that becomes an endearing listen.\n\nThe strengths of \u2018Everyday Life\u2019 instead lie in the band\u2019s musical left turns and lyrical experiments. Sunrise\u2019s \u2018Trouble In Town\u2019 is a searing indictment of police brutality and systemic racism (\u201cTrouble in town / Because they hung my brother brown / [\u2026] Blood on the beat\u201d). A recording of misconduct by US law enforcement precedes a visceral crescendo of \u2018A Rush of Blood To The Head\u2019-era piano rock, with Buckland\u2019s reverb guitar signatures clashing with keys and detuned synths.\n\n\u2018Arabesque\u2019 is another highlight. It\u2019s one of Coldplay\u2019s most atypical songs, with Nigerian brass arrangements blasting over a hulking, psychedelic prog-rock backbone. Three generations of the Kuti family appear on the record \u2013 so does Palestinian oud group Le Trio Joubran and Belgian superstar singer Stromae \u2013 which makes for a fittingly globetrotting record that espouses unity in the human race (\u201cwe share the same blood\u201d).\n\nThe song\u2019s accompanying A-side single \u2013 and the record\u2019s centrepiece \u2013 \u2018Orphans\u2019, details hope amid the bleak narrative of the Syrian civil war. It\u2019s the album\u2019s obvious lead single, thrust with a slinky bassline, syncopated Afrobeat percussion and spirited choral sing-a-longs. We\u2019ve had our fill of \u201cwoops\u201d and \u201cwoo-hoos\u201d across the band\u2019s \u2018A Head Full of Dreams\u2019 though. You\u2019re tempted to think: Please, no more.\n\nThankfully, penultimate track \u2018Champion of the World\u2019 (which uses the emotive guitar hook from \u2018Los Angeles, Be Kind\u2019, the work of the late Scott Huchison\u2019s Owl John side project) rescues an otherwise trailing part two of \u2018Everyday Life\u2019. It\u2019s a slow-burning ballad dedicated to believing in yourself, replete with the widescreen indie rock flair reminiscent of Doves\u2019 \u2018There Goes The Fear\u2019. The closing title track, with its blooming strings and repeated chants of \u201cHallelujah\u201d, sets you up for a \u2018Fix You\u2019-style cry fest but slightly short-circuits the whole thing. Still, it\u2019s an interesting decision for a band that trades in build-and-release euphoric pop \u2013 and maybe that\u2019s the point.\n\nUltimately, \u2018Everyday Life\u2019 is something of a confounding experiment. On the one hand it\u2019s full of eclectic sounds and ideas \u2013 an Iranian poem interlude here (\u2018Bani Adam\u2019), a country-blues musing on gun control there (\u2018Guns\u2019) \u2013 that offer a welcome respite from Coldplay tropes. True, these songs are sometimes more exciting in theory than in practise (not something you\u2019d have said of, for instance, the Brian Eno-assisted \u2018Viva La Vida\u2019), but \u2018Everyday Life\u2019 regularly steps to the left-field, proving that Coldplay are more adventurous than they\u2019re often given credit for.\n\nSOURCE: https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/coldplay-everyday-life-review-2577508",
